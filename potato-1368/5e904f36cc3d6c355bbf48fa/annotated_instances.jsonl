I\u2019ve been doing research here and there and see overall great results, mixed with nausea and some bad lows. \n\nHas anyone had success starting one of these drugs and avoiding lows? I\u2019ve seen people mention a total daily insulin reduction of 25%-50%. Maybe I reduce basal down 25 or 50% from the get go and see how much the GLP-1 drug contributes and increase insulin from there if needed? \n\nAny input is much appreciated!</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> I\u2019ve tried both, no issues with lows. I have a tslim and it will just reduce my basal if needed.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> Took 4th dose of 0.25mg today. Was on Lantus + Apidra earlier. Take 0.25mg Ozempic weekly, plus 18U Lantus daily + 2-4 units Apidra if BS spikes over 250.   \nPrior to Ozempic, my BS was wild stayed above 250 usually and will get 3-4 hypos in a day if increased either basal or bolus. Before breakfast I would wake up with BS around 130 and upon walking up to freshen up, before doing anything (like within 15 minutes getting out of bed) eating anything BS would spike to 180... ON FASTING STOMACH. It does not happen anymore \\~ high BS spikes are much controlled. Response to short acting insulin is much better. But I get a daily hypo around 6-7 AM if I am not hyper-vigilant. Sucks. Usually I wake up at 9-10 am not before that. But cant afford rn.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> I am a T1 who has been on Saxenda for about 2 months. I use O5 and G6. I have had 2 bad lows in this entire time, and honestly, think that the second one came about as a result of alcohol. I was at a music festival at an all inclusive resort with friends who drink a lot and honestly having 2 drinks a day along with edibles over the course of 4 days, by the last night, I had a horrific low that wasn't even registering on G6 and I had to administer glucagon. I do not think that it was my medication, more that blip in my lifestyle radar. (In my normal life, I have like 2 drinks a week, maybe.) When I got home, I told my endo and she had me change some settings in manual mode, but since then, I haven't had any lows. \n\nI saw my endo and my A1C decreased from 7.1 to 6.6, my TIR is absurd, like 90%, and I have lost about 15 pounds. This is only 2 months in. I did have side effects in the beginning, head aches, queasiness, I vomited twice mostly due to eating too close to bed time (your stomach empties slower), but overall, it's a pretty big help. \n\nI think about it this way. In normies (without obesity, but with a pancreas), there is an organ that secretes all of these hormones to keep us in check. There aren't ONLY (insulin secreting) beta cells in your pancreas, there are 5 cell types that secrete a whole bunch of hormones -glucagon, insulin, somatostatin, ghrelin, and pancreatic polypeptide. For us, our pancreas is destroyed, but by only taking insulin, we are only replacing that one hormone and not the other hormones that have also been taken out as a result of the autoimmune process. \n\nMy endo also had me not go up to the highest dose, which would have been my next step. I am currently at 2.4 mg daily. It is still working well. \n\nGood luck, and hope you don't have any issues finding your med! It's a problem and whatever you do, DO NOT USE COMPOUNDED PRODUCT. Use only the innovator product in pens.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> I kept my basal the same and split bolus for meals, that way I can increase/decrease on the second half as needed.

So that's the first thing I can work on. Could you do this? I doubt it would show up so soon though. \n\nBut other than thst my bg has been massively out of range with huge unpredictability over the last few weeks, the insulin doesn't seem to be working and is taking absolutely ages to work even with high activity.I reordered new pens in case the ones I have are not as effective (??), \n\nIts a marathon not a sprint tho, this is lifelong and the last 6 weeks are a drop in a big ocean.

I told her I wasn\u2019t doing that, told her what prescriptions I needed refilled, and told her I MIGHT try one of her suggestions that came from whatever magic fake ass diabetes calculator she uses. I consulted my magic 8 ball later - I was better off that way.\n\nI didn\u2019t quite say I dose myself based off ~ViBeS~ last time I went in, but I did say I relied a lot on how I felt, and most days I feel different than I did the day before.

The insulin is doing something, it's fighting a protein spike, fighting delayed carbs because of fat, fighting dehydration, or fighting blood sugar from stress.\n\nEnough insulin will bring it down. Check the site, if insulin isn't leaking out there's a good chance it's getting in. Wait a few hours and change it if it's still fucked.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> With my daughter, we always think site first.  How long has it been on?  If you just put it on, maybe the cannula is bent.  Has it been on for 5 days, probably site has gone bad.  Did you just change the reservoir, how long has the insulin been open?  We also keep one or two unopened pens, just for emergencies.  If we think it is the insulin, get out a pen a d see what happens.  Really it is trial and error, but depending on site age and when you opened your last vial, you can make a good guess.  We have not run into her suddenly having Issues with insulin working g.  Hope that helps.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> Take your hands and gently wipe them all around the adhesive on your site. If you smell insulin, in your hands, that is a leak/tunneling. Change your site.\n\nIf your site hurts a lot, change your site.\n\nIf your site feels loose, change your site.\n\nSites often aren\u2019t suitable anymore well before they seem totally ready to come off. My sites can last anywhere from 2-5 days depending on where they are and what I\u2019m doing. Usually 3-4.\n\nMake sure you have enough infusion sets so you aren\u2019t unnecessarily rationing infusion sets if your doctors and insurance will allow it.\n\nWith respect to your last question, site issues are easiest to diagnose. The rest is much harder. Count carbs, pay attention to if your meal was fatty or had lots of protein in it (may require more insulin), and whether you have been actively lately.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> Rage bolus. \n\nI'm kidding but for real, if a rage bolus doesn't do anything then the insulin is bad. It's a horrible idea and we all know we shouldn't do it... that said, I am who I am and I'll rage if I want to.

If something isn't working, I will rip it all out and start fresh instead of experimenting on myself and staying high.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> Give yourself an injection with the same insulin - do you come down?

I\u2019m not of legal drinking age yet so I haven\u2019t gone balls to the walls or anything, but I\u2019ve also been trying to safely figure out how to do this. \n\nDefinitely go into it with something substantial in your stomach. I usually go for something fatty and protein based, eggs and hash browns are my go to. Stay hydrated before/during/after. Basic drinking protocol. \n\nI usually try to make sure I have a CGM in and working so I can spot trouble ahead of time. The biggest problem you\u2019ll probably have is lows, probably hours after drinking while your liver is still busy metabolizing what you\u2019ve drank. You can either be really slack about your blousing during the night, I\u2019ll bolus for any meals I have, but small stuff, candy, mixers, I\u2019ll usually leave until the end of the night. I usually try to do this by including a mixed drink or cup of punch a for every few beers/shots I have. If this seems too cavalier for you, I\u2019ve had lots of success having 15-25 carbs of a snack before bed. I try to pack it in whatever bag I take with me, usually a ziplock bag of oreos or thin mints. I\u2019d also recommend an emergency snack just in case you do dip and have nothing on hand. \n\nThese strategies are really important because glucagons do not work while your body is processing alcohol. When in doubt, aim high, because this isn\u2019t the time to pass out because of a hypo. Have somebody that can recongnize your symptoms really well, this is also really tricky because being low looks and sounds and feels a lot like being drunk.
