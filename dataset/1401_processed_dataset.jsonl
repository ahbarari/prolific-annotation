The cabin has facilities & a refrigerator.

Also know kiddo needs to have high glucose when we set out in the a.m. for a physically active day (hiking), and we need to have lots of fruit, Gatorade, candy/quick sugar on hand all day. We are a sml group and can set our pace to meet my T1D's needs. Kiddo won't have a pump yet, but does have a cgm.

Be aware if the outdoor activities are such that they are a \"stress\" you may see blood glucose rise due to epinephrine > hepatic glucagon >>> glucose. Given the lag between sensor interstitial fluid glucose reading and actual blood glucose (up to 25 min.), set the alarm to no less than 80 mg/dL and, more importantly, make decisions based on the trend so you can intercept lows before they occur. Once you have a pump, this will be easier to navigate but still requires mindful choices (not mindless).\n\nMy sensor transmits to iPhone and I can see the reading and trend on Apple Watch.

If they are having any symptoms, it may not be diabetes but may be just as serious."}, {"id": 2, "text": "The symptoms of high blood sugar can be numerous but just vauge enough that they can be confused with other maladies or sometimes just normal ups and downs of kids.\n\nBut in general, they present themselves in the following ways:\n\n1. Thirst, often extreme. Kids being kids, their first intinct will often be to reach for a sugary drink to relieve the thirst, which makes it worse\n\n2. Frequent urination (sometimes, but not always, the urine will have a mildly sweet aroma)\n\n3. Fatigue, often extreme\n\n4. Headaches\n\n5. Feeling warm/sweaty without enviornmental trigger\n\n6. Ravenous hunger, often times not helped with food.\n\n7. Unexpected weight loss or inability to gain weight\n\nThese will often worsen or become more obvious as sugars move higher. In the most severe cases, diabetes needing immediate medical intervention will present with vomiting, shallow breathing, woozy ness, etc.\n\nIf your child has several of these symptoms regularly, then it would be wise to check with your doctor. It doesn't necessaril mean diabetes, but it could be or any other number of treatable conditions.\n\nFailing that, most drug stores now sell over the counter gluconeters and test strips that are not absurdly expensive and do not require a prescription. You can use one of those to check your kiddo's blood sugar a few times (make sure to read up on proper testing procedure first).\n\nIf their fasting glucose (not having esten for 8 hours) is under 70 or over 120 or if their post meal glucose is over 170-180, then that is awarning sign something is up and it's time to see the doctor immediately.\n\nBut beyond that my advice would be... don't panic, regardless of what you discover via symptoms and/or testing. They may be diabetic. They may very well not. But even if they are, while it isn't fun and presents many challenges, it is treatable and manageable. And as a parent you are doing the right thing and asking the right questions by checking now."}, {"id": 3, "text": "I was 3.

So then the third night I get him up to use the bathroom. But the following night he does it again. I googled the peeing in bed part, and it mentioned type 1.
