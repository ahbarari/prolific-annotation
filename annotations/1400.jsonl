Just half a year ago I moved away from my family and I live on my own in a rented apartment. I have diabetes for almost 11 years now but I find it increasingly difficult to manage it. Despite the fact that I'm doing literally everything I've been told by my doctor I cannot seem to cope with hyperglycemias. It's more frustrating now since I have important exams that will determine if I'll pass or not. I cannot concentrate, I'm restless even if I sleep longer than I should and learning anything is nearly impossible. I cannot even do the simplest tasks and it's also taking a great toll on my job.

For those who have tight control it would be a nightmare. I listened to an interview with the founder on The Juice box and he stated that \"post meal of up to 270 was acceptable to their algorithm\". I'm sorry, but if I'm at 205 I'm already range bolusing. If I'm over 220 or so I feel like death.

More like homework or self-study, so you can really maximize what you learn from your team.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 6:</b> Carb counting is done by reading the labels, looking up carb counts on the internet, with an app, or in a book. So if you eat a piece of steak and a cup of broccoli you look it up and learn that the steak has no carbs and the broccoli has the amount your app or book says. You will memorize many foods over time. Next you have to dose for any carbs you\u2019re gonna eat. For every certain amount of carbs you will need a certain amount of insulin. That\u2019s called a carb ratio and with some math you can calculate how much insulin you need at each meal. Except that your carb ratio might be different at different times of the day and you may need to add more insulin if you are high. Yes, it\u2019s complicated but you will get it in time. If you are going low at night you probably have too much Tresiba. There are exceptions. Wake up at 12 and three to treat lows unless you have an odd bedtime or you wake to CGM alarms. A prebolus means you are dosing for food before you eat. You might dose five minutes to forty five min before depending on how high you are and how fast the food will be, etc. Only do this later when you know more. Did your doctor tell you to eat according to a meal plan where every meal is already set? If yes, just follow that plan until told otherwise. Don\u2019t dose before bed unless you wont sleep through a low.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 7:</b> Pretty recently diagnosed here..\nMy endo told me to inject 1 unit of bolus (in my case apidra) for every 10 g of carbs. And for the random spikes during the day (without eating anything) is to inject 1-1.5 units for every 2 mmol/l to the normal level (e.g. if my sugar level is 11 mmol/l and I want to lower it to 5 mmol/l I have to inject 3-4 units)\nRequires some math, but pretty accurate for me (so far))<br><br>\n", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 505, "end": 809, "span": "What country are you in?

Just half a year ago I moved away from my family and I live on my own in a rented apartment. I have diabetes for almost 11 years now but I find it increasingly difficult to manage it. Despite the fact that I'm doing literally everything I've been told by my doctor I cannot seem to cope with hyperglycemias. It's more frustrating now since I have important exams that will determine if I'll pass or not. I cannot concentrate, I'm restless even if I sleep longer than I should and learning anything is nearly impossible. I cannot even do the simplest tasks and it's also taking a great toll on my job. Is there anything I can possibly do to somehow supress hyperglycemias effectively in a short period of time? How do you deal with them? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> brisk walk does magic \ud83c\udfa9<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> Is there a pattern? Does the hyperglycemia occur at consistent times, for example after meals or overnight? If it is a regular, recurring thing, it might just mean that you need more insulin at those times. Do you adjust your doses on your own or wait for your doctor to do it? Does it happen when you are stressed at school, such as before an exam? That can be a little harder to control but if it's very consistent (happening every time you have an exam or presentation or whatever) then taking a bit of extra insulin then might also help until you get more used to the new activities and are less stressed by them. As someone else mentioned, a quick walk can also get the insulin working better.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> Either exercise, get insulin, or drink water. I also eat snow sometimes.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> Might seem totally unrelated but the \u201cfight/flight\u201d response kicks in automatically.

More like homework or self-study, so you can really maximize what you learn from your team.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 6:</b> Carb counting is done by reading the labels, looking up carb counts on the internet, with an app, or in a book. So if you eat a piece of steak and a cup of broccoli you look it up and learn that the steak has no carbs and the broccoli has the amount your app or book says. You will memorize many foods over time. Next you have to dose for any carbs you\u2019re gonna eat. For every certain amount of carbs you will need a certain amount of insulin. That\u2019s called a carb ratio and with some math you can calculate how much insulin you need at each meal. Except that your carb ratio might be different at different times of the day and you may need to add more insulin if you are high. Yes, it\u2019s complicated but you will get it in time. If you are going low at night you probably have too much Tresiba. There are exceptions. Wake up at 12 and three to treat lows unless you have an odd bedtime or you wake to CGM alarms. A prebolus means you are dosing for food before you eat. You might dose five minutes to forty five min before depending on how high you are and how fast the food will be, etc. Only do this later when you know more. Did your doctor tell you to eat according to a meal plan where every meal is already set? If yes, just follow that plan until told otherwise.

Just half a year ago I moved away from my family and I live on my own in a rented apartment. I have diabetes for almost 11 years now but I find it increasingly difficult to manage it. Despite the fact that I'm doing literally everything I've been told by my doctor I cannot seem to cope with hyperglycemias. It's more frustrating now since I have important exams that will determine if I'll pass or not. I cannot concentrate, I'm restless even if I sleep longer than I should and learning anything is nearly impossible. I cannot even do the simplest tasks and it's also taking a great toll on my job.

Does the hyperglycemia occur at consistent times, for example after meals or overnight? If it is a regular, recurring thing, it might just mean that you need more insulin at those times. Do you adjust your doses on your own or wait for your doctor to do it? Does it happen when you are stressed at school, such as before an exam? That can be a little harder to control but if it's very consistent (happening every time you have an exam or presentation or whatever) then taking a bit of extra insulin then might also help until you get more used to the new activities and are less stressed by them. As someone else mentioned, a quick walk can also get the insulin working better.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> Either exercise, get insulin, or drink water. I also eat snow sometimes.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> Might seem totally unrelated but the \u201cfight/flight\u201d response kicks in automatically. Over the years it\u2019s easily increased stress levels and subsequent cortisol levels that also affect BG. Breathing and grounding helps me.

You can also over-bolus and back off your basal later, but I haven\u2019t gotten to try that yet because I\u2019m MDI.\n\nI also stuck a water bottle next to my pens and I drink water when I take the insulin. It has helped my prebolus time.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> Eat less during meals but have small snacks between meals.\n\nAnother useful thing to do is to manage basal(s). I use different basal rates for different activities e.g., sleep, sedentary day, and varying levels of physical activity.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> Sometimes 15 minutes isn\u2019t enough time depending on what you eat! For fatty meals I barely pre-bolus while stuff like cookies/cake I have to wait like 30-40 minutes before eating cause it hits me super fast. Try waiting a little longer and see if that helps. If not, perhaps your ratio isn\u2019t quite dialed in. Keep in mind it\u2019s not uncommon for your ratio to change throughout the day. Mine is wack in the mornings, lower in the afternoons and pretty normal in the evenings.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 6:</b> Depending on which way you blood is going I find a short walk after eating helps get the insulin working. If your trending down it will lead to a low. If I take insulin and eat with no exercise my blood goes high no matter what I take<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 7:</b> I use 45 minutes to treat before eating carbs. 15 minutes for protein.

I used to have bad sleep apnea and i think my body was releasing cortisol, sending my blood sugar straight up<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> Because your liver releases glucose at night while you sleep it happens to everyone even non diabetics but their pancreas works so it combats it to stays at a normal blood sugar. The only way you can control this as a diabetic is to have a insulin pump. Apparently their is another before bed shot you can take on top of your basil but my endo says it sucks. The pump is basically the most reliable healthy way to prevent this night time glucose rise.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> Probably need to adjust your basil. Do you have a pump or do you use pens?<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> When people go low at night it\u2019s sometimes too much basal I think. So maybe take more since you are experiencing the opposite if that makes sense. Or just ask your doctor.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> When do you take your basal? If you take it on a morning you're possibly \"running out\" overnight. \n\nI take Lantus just before bed and in the last fortnight I've had to reduce by 8 units because of overnight lows, despite running high for months I've suddenly started to have lows.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 6:</b> Get a pump<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 7:</b> You need to up your basal dosage.

Usually you should be able to go to a diabetes centre to receive proper and thorough education about how to handle your diabetes.

The amount of time that works best varies, I find about 20 minutes before eating is ideal.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> Contact your medical personnel about this!! But I\u2019ll say that if you have lows at night it might indicate that the Tresiba dose is too high.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> In addition to the above, if your Endocrinologist hasn\u2019t reviewed this with you then I\u2019d strongly recommend looking for a new Endo. You\u2019re new to this and they should\u2019ve ensured you have the basic down when they put you on these prescriptions. Glad you came here for support.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> You might benefit from Juicebox podcast \"pro series.\"\n\nThis does not replace seeking guidance from your endocrinology clinic team.  More like homework or self-study, so you can really maximize what you learn from your team.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 6:</b> Carb counting is done by reading the labels, looking up carb counts on the internet, with an app, or in a book. So if you eat a piece of steak and a cup of broccoli you look it up and learn that the steak has no carbs and the broccoli has the amount your app or book says. You will memorize many foods over time. Next you have to dose for any carbs you\u2019re gonna eat. For every certain amount of carbs you will need a certain amount of insulin. That\u2019s called a carb ratio and with some math you can calculate how much insulin you need at each meal. Except that your carb ratio might be different at different times of the day and you may need to add more insulin if you are high. Yes, it\u2019s complicated but you will get it in time. If you are going low at night you probably have too much Tresiba. There are exceptions. Wake up at 12 and three to treat lows unless you have an odd bedtime or you wake to CGM alarms. A prebolus means you are dosing for food before you eat. You might dose five minutes to forty five min before depending on how high you are and how fast the food will be, etc. Only do this later when you know more. Did your doctor tell you to eat according to a meal plan where every meal is already set? If yes, just follow that plan until told otherwise. Don\u2019t dose before bed unless you wont sleep through a low.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 7:</b> Pretty recently diagnosed here..\nMy endo told me to inject 1 unit of bolus (in my case apidra) for every 10 g of carbs. And for the random spikes during the day (without eating anything) is to inject 1-1.5 units for every 2 mmol/l to the normal level (e.g. if my sugar level is 11 mmol/l and I want to lower it to 5 mmol/l I have to inject 3-4 units)\nRequires some math, but pretty accurate for me (so far))<br><br>\n", "label_annotations": {"no_claim": {"No claim detected.": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 50s "}}
