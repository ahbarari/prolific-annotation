I have never drank before but I would like to be able to drink with my friends. I understand that drinking can be very dangerous. I have a cgm and a pump and I am using the loop app to manage BG. I read that hard liquor can lower blood sugars, how does that work? Can I get around this by just lowering my basal and not worrying about it? How do I drink safely with T1D?</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> (Assuming 16 is the legal drinking age in your country)\n\neat a meal before you start drinking, preferably with a glass of water. \n\nknow what a serving of alcohol is no matter the type of alcohol,\n\nno more than 1 serving of alcohol per hour,\n\nalways have a designated driver, I also make sure people know to call 911 if I can't be woken they are not allowed to use my insulin on me.\n\nI drink sugary mixed drinks because I find that drinking lowers my blood sugar enough that my sugary mixed drinks keep me up, but I have to keep something next to the bed, because I usually go low before I wake up the next day. The only way to know how alcohol affects you personally is to keep your CGM close at all times.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> When your liver is processing alcohol, it will stop releasing glucose. If you still have basal insulin running at the normal rate, than your blood sugar will drop. There are different strategies for handling this. Lowering your basal rate and/or having a closed loop system do it for you is helpful. Make sure to never drink on an empty stomach. Be mindful that some alcoholic drinks have a lot of sugar and you may not need to bolus as much as you would for a nonalcoholic version of that same drink. Basically, a lot of trial and error. Keep an eye on your blood sugar.  And drink plenty of water. Cheers!<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> At your age: make sure your parents are OK with it. Seriously. Because if it goes wrong - and at some stage, it will - they need to know what's been going on and not be guessing. Trust me on this. It may have saved my life when I was 17 and stupid.\n\nHave food on board. Don't be alone. Try, if you can, to avoid drinking to excess. Experiment, slowly. I don't mean outrageous mixes, I mean:\n\n* 1 beer on its own, no insulin does: this.\n* 1 beer, 1 unit just as I drink it does: this.\n* 1 shot, on its own, no insulin, does: this\n\nAnd so on. It's a little hit or miss. But you'll build your own little library of alcohol affects you. There are generalizations of how alcohol affects T1s. They are generalizations, not universal truths. Hard liquor with no mixers doesn't affect me, nor does white wine. Beer does, and the hoppier/darker it is, the more it does. Insulin required, and no, it doesn't drop me afterwards.\n\nIf your parents are cool with it, do the experiment and note taking with them present; that might help them trust you a bit more. If they're not, find your most responsible trustworthy friend and do it with him. Have glucose and insulin nearby and make sure he or she knows the difference.\n\nAt some point you're going to fuck up. Practice your apology speech now.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> It\u2019s not that dangerous, you have a CGM. People here seem to forget diabetes and drinking has been around a hell of a lot longer than CGMs have. I highly disagree with bringing other people into the fold beyond \u201chey I\u2019m diabetic, if I ask for sugar bring me sugar\u201d but to each their own. \n\nDon\u2019t do straight liquor or hunch punch that some dude made for the party. No one that age can pace themselves and it goes off the rails very easily. Beer is awesome. \n\nDon\u2019t take insulin for any drinks you have. Have low sugar snacks on hand. \n\nIt\u2019s always better to be slightly high than it is to be super low while drinking. Give yourself a buffer. You can always take insulin if you\u2019re running high towards the end of the night. \n\nYou\u2019ll learn how to handle it, folks go way overboard with this, it\u2019s not that complicated. You don\u2019t need insulin for drinks unless you\u2019re smashing a bunch of sugary alcoholic drinks, which, don\u2019t do that. Jack and regular coke? Don\u2019t. Orange juice and vodka? Don\u2019t. Have low supplies and play it safe with a buffer. Easy.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> https://www.jdrf.org/t1d-resources/living-with-t1d/food-and-diet/diabetes-and-alcohol/<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 6:</b> I don't personally drink, but I have been told that if I were to, to have a sober friend who is willing to keep an eye on me for the night, willing and able to wake me up if I were to have a hypo during the night<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 7:</b> Please ignore the blanket advice of \"your body will do this\", \"your body will do that\". \n\nThere is ZERO guarantee that you will respond in the predictable manner.\n\nFor instance, I go high and stay high with alcohol, no matter the type. A shot of straight vodka has the same effect for me as a regular soda. But it lasts longer\n\nThe only safer way to drink is start slow, in the safety of your own home, with both high and low supplies and preferably either on your own or with a friend or two.\n\nThe more calm and alert you are to your diabetes while drinking, for the first time, the better. \n\nFinding out how you'll respond at a raging party is not a good idea. \n\nBut, testing the waters on your own can help you during those parties.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 8:</b> Don't drink for the first time while out with freinds. Do it at home with your parents present until you learned how  your body handle alchohol and drinks of different sugar and carb levels.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 9:</b> When I first started drinking (and continuing drinking all night) I used to drink one alcoholic drink, and then a pint of water. I alternated between booze and water until I got older and more experienced with booze.\n\nI would definitely recommend this for anyone, for a number of reasons. 1. You\u2019ll fill up with liquid faster so physically won\u2019t be able to drink as much (good for learning how much alcohol your body can handle, and acclimating your body to alcohol). 2. You\u2019ll be that one annoying prick in the morning who wakes up after a night out with no hangover \ud83d\ude02\n\nI\u2019ve learnt over the years that shots, spirits, liquor, just don\u2019t do my body any favours. This isn\u2019t diabetes related, just me not being able to stomach strong alcohol.\n\nThe advice about sticking to beer is good, as it can be gassy, and fills you up quicker, so you physically can\u2019t drink as much alcohol. Same sort of deal as the drinking water in between.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 10:</b> I measured how many milliliters are in my average mouthful. For me 1 gulp is about 50 mL and a sip is about 25 mL. I took different sized mouthfuls of water and spat them into a bowl on my food scale. Did that enough times to find my average. \nWhen I drink i know how much carbs are per 100mL and the math is pretty simple, just need to keep track of how many sips/gulps u take. I have a scoreboard of how much i drank in my head that i can visualize.\n\nThis is also a good hack for if you need to correct a low with a beverage and you dont have any measuring cups\u203c\ufe0f\n\nWith beer and hard cider i bolus per usual. With hard alcohol i always eat something with it and bolus around 70% of what i usually would(for carbs in food and alcohol combined) For wine i bolus for 25% of the carbs but dont need to eat while drinkinkg (although i usually am lol).\n\nI always eat a handful of nuts and chocolate chips before going to bed after drinking bc its a good fat:carb:protein ratio for me<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 11:</b> I was diagnosed at 16, 20 yrs ago. I felt the need to feel *normal* and do normal teen stuff. You can have fun, but please utilize your CGM and don't feed the urge to keep pushing things. I drank in college too, and sometimes I wonder how I didn't die. Drinking too much can spike your sugars like crazy, and then while you're hungover drop like crazy, and when you feeling like dog turds after having a few too many, it's harder to stay on top of actually taking care of yourself, it's not worth it. I wish I could tell my younger self to cool it drinking heavily with peers, having fun and imbibing is not a competition, enjoy your time with friends without thinking you need to drink *all* the drinks. If cannabis is kind to you, it's more fun blazing instead of tying too many on, you won't lose your wits/senses like you will with alcohol. Having fun and exploring is a part of growing up, but please be kind to yourself and please take advantage of the info your CGM provides in this time of discovery. Be safe and trust your common sense!<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 12:</b> Assume that you need less insulin when you have been drinking. Especially is you're out dancing, you might not need to correct for highs. \n\nDon't drink on an empty stomach. \n\nAlways carry glucose tablets and snacks. \n\nEducate your friends what to do in case you get too low. \n\nAlways eat something (perhaps even without bolusing) before you sleep.<br><br>\n", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 1333, "end": 1402, "span": "When your liver is processing alcohol, it will stop releasing glucose", "annotation": "verifiable claim"}, {"start": 1404, "end": 1496, "span": "If you still have basal insulin running at the normal rate, than your blood sugar will drop.", "annotation": "verifiable claim"}], "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 3m 8s "}}

I googled for answers to no avail. I am an organ donor, but I wondered if there\u2019s a way to reserve my pancreas for my son to receive when I die? Just curious how I would even go about it.\n\nWe are the same blood type, btw.</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> His pancreas still does some jobs. If he were to receive yours, he would trade T1d for immunosuppressants. Most people don\u2019t find that trade off to be worth it. Usually, the people who get pancreas transplants are already getting something else transplanted, like a liver. Since they will require immunosuppressants anyway, the trade off is worth it.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> Pancreas transplants are fairly rare, difficult to pull off, and generally only offer a short term benefit.  The immunosuppressants required are probably worse than controlling T1.  If I remember correctly even those with successful transplants have a 50% chance of being back on insulin at five years.  It's a lovely thought to have your kid get your pancreas but it's not really a solution.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> The average lifespan of a transplanted pancreas is 10 years. The younger he is when he has a transplant, the more likely he will need more than 1.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> Pancreas transplants aren't really a viable method of treating diabetes, and is considered a last resort option. Transplants don't last forever, and some don't even last a year. Even if your son got lucky he'd probably only survive a decade or two after getting a transplant. The half life of pancreas transplants is 11 years, meaning in half of patients who have them the transplant fails before 11 years, and half fail after. As far as I can tell, the record for the longest surviving pancreas transplant is 24 years. \n\nType one can be managed for a lifetime, and we're closer and closer to a cure all the time. Your kid has a better chance just living with diabetes and hoping for a cure to be finished than trying to get an unnecessary transplant. I don't want to get your hopes up, but with where we are now it's pretty likely a cure will be possible by the time he is an adult.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> Aside from the drawbacks noted by others, you didn't say where you live. It's a bit hard to advise when nobody knows what laws might be applicable in your jurisdiction.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 6:</b> It\u2019s more than just immunosuppressive issues. His pancreas is perfectly fine. T1D isn\u2019t a pancreas issue, it\u2019s and antibody issue. His body is literally attacking the beta cells in the pancreas, causing the pancreas to have issues. He won\u2019t lose the antibodies he has because there was an organ donor. People don\u2019t really do transplants because it\u2019s highly likely the body will eventually attack the new pancreas. There has to be some sort of antibody treatment and immunosuppressive along with the transplant. \n\nMost the new trials for pancreas treatment are actually trying to find a way to make the antibodies mission of killing the pancreas unsuccessful. When doing so the pancreas should go back to normal and beta cells will work again.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 7:</b> Immunosupressants will be needed. I am not a medical professional but your kid's immune system might think that your pancreas is also a threat so the trade off is not worth it. If they are doing fine without it, then don't let them have the misfortune of a very weak immune system that can cause more issues.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 8:</b> I would strongly advise against pancreatic dontations as a treatment for T1D unless a doctor recommends it for two specific reasons:\n\nOrgan transplantation is a serious surgery generally considered a last resort for people with major complications or severely brittle diabetes with complications. This is because receiving an organ through transplanting then requires the receiver to take immunoupressants for life to prevent rejection. This puts them at risk for any number of infections and other medical problems.\n\nTransplantation also does not gaurantee their immune system won't once again attack and destory the islet cells that make insulin. In many cases, a new pancreas only \"cures\" someone from needing injected insulin for a short period of time.\n\nI woukd recommend talking to your doctor about this option.

No matter what I\u2019ve tried I\u2019ve never been able to run for longer than 20 minutes or so without going low unless I consume a ton of sugar during my runs.

You might even notice on some runs the adrenaline will increase your blood sugar. Start small and as you become comfortable, try to increase time / distance etc. It can be done - I have run a marathon & over a dozen half's. Like everything else - it's harder for us than the average person. Good luck!<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> I\u2019ve never found exercise mode to be useful for cardio because the autoboluses for a rising blood sugar cause me to crash hard. I actually use sleep mode instead when exercising and it\u2019s great because it doesn\u2019t give the autoboluses. Regardless, I also have about 15g of sugar 15 minutes before exercising and another 15g every half hour or so if I\u2019m doing a long run and I\u2019ll stay pretty stable \u2014 it\u2019ll be different for everyone but that\u2019s what I\u2019ve found to work for me.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> I LOVE my tandem... except when it comes to exercise. If I\u2019m doing intense cardio, I crash really hard really fast. When I first got type one, I would have to be at 250-300 in order to exercise and not crash. My old pump had a setting where you could lower your basal rate by whatever percentage before exercising. That works perfect because I would just take 50% for the hour before. That way I wouldn\u2019t climb too high before or crash during. Because tandem has the control IQ, it automatically corrects me when I\u2019m trying to raise my blood sugar before exercising. It\u2019s super frustrating. I have to turn it off for at least a half hour before exercising. The Exercise Activity setting is useless. I have figured out that breaking my exercise into smaller chunks, like two brisk 30 minute walks a day, is much better- or I will under dose a meal and exercise right after. If I want to do a full hour of cardio, then I usually turn off my pump for 30 minutes before I don\u2019t restart it until 30 to 45 minutes into exercising. I\u2019m not sure which is better- The ups and downs your blood sugar goes through when exercising, or just doing gentle forms of exercise that don\u2019t change your blood sugar but don\u2019t always help with your cardiovascular health.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 6:</b> For me, it really depends on how much insulin on board I have. Running increases seems to at least double my insulin sensitivity. I try to aim for 1 unit or less of IOB before I start. If I am high before, I only take half my normal correction.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 7:</b> Running especially would tank me. What finally worked for me was lowering my basal by 50% about 30 mins before the run and down to 30% before heading out the door. If I had any insulin on board, I would have a light snack (a clementine and some pb for example). I also made sure I had some glucose gels while on my run. \n\nThere was a lot of trial and error and shorter runs to figure this out. Don\u2019t get discouraged! You can do it. \n\nAlso, control iq isn\u2019t for everyone. I also have a dexcom and tslim. While I love them, I do a better job than control iq (it\u2019s not aggressive enough for me).<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 8:</b> For me, running in the morning (before breakfast) requires almost no adjustment.  But I can't really do mornings, so in the afternoon, I only run 3 hours after a meal, do a 50 percent basal for 1 hour, and drink a cup of Gatorade right before going out.

UK resident here and I would like to hopefully get some help from friends on this sub.\n\nRecently I've decided I want to start eating healthy, had a bit of a spell of eating so many bags of crisps and choccy bars lol. I have started replacing carb heavy meals (more than 60g carbs) with low carb alternatives so for example for tea today I ate.\n\n- 80g Brussel sprouts\n- 80g Carrots\n- 80g Broccoli\n- 80g cauliflower\n- 200g chicken\n\nNow the carbohydrates of this meal added up to around 15g carbs. I also add mint sauce and mix it in for flavour so that is like an extra 5-10g carbs.\n\nSo for this meal I take 3 units of Novo-rapid insulin. I have this meal a few times per week however I always notice that my blood sugar levels will rise from around 5.6mmol/L(100.8Mg/dl) to 12(216Mg/dl), about 3 hours later, needing me to take a correction. (Estimation but it always rises a bit)\n\nI've looked at the carb content time and time again and meticiously measured them and they are bang on. I know my insulin sensitivity is ok because when I eat porridge for breakfast my blood sugar goes fine.\n\nSo I guess my question is, is there a way to Protein count in diet? Similar to the way we carb count, as I imagine it's the chickens fault? As well as the veg which I think contain protein too.\n\n\nThanks all.\nDan</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> Trial and error basically.

I read that hard liquor can lower blood sugars, how does that work? Can I get around this by just lowering my basal and not worrying about it? How do I drink safely with T1D?</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> (Assuming 16 is the legal drinking age in your country)\n\neat a meal before you start drinking, preferably with a glass of water. \n\nknow what a serving of alcohol is no matter the type of alcohol,\n\nno more than 1 serving of alcohol per hour,\n\nalways have a designated driver, I also make sure people know to call 911 if I can't be woken they are not allowed to use my insulin on me.\n\nI drink sugary mixed drinks because I find that drinking lowers my blood sugar enough that my sugary mixed drinks keep me up, but I have to keep something next to the bed, because I usually go low before I wake up the next day. The only way to know how alcohol affects you personally is to keep your CGM close at all times.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> When your liver is processing alcohol, it will stop releasing glucose. If you still have basal insulin running at the normal rate, than your blood sugar will drop. There are different strategies for handling this. Lowering your basal rate and/or having a closed loop system do it for you is helpful. Make sure to never drink on an empty stomach. Be mindful that some alcoholic drinks have a lot of sugar and you may not need to bolus as much as you would for a nonalcoholic version of that same drink. Basically, a lot of trial and error. Keep an eye on your blood sugar.  And drink plenty of water. Cheers!<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> At your age: make sure your parents are OK with it. Seriously. Because if it goes wrong - and at some stage, it will - they need to know what's been going on and not be guessing. Trust me on this. It may have saved my life when I was 17 and stupid.\n\nHave food on board. Don't be alone. Try, if you can, to avoid drinking to excess. Experiment, slowly. I don't mean outrageous mixes, I mean:\n\n* 1 beer on its own, no insulin does: this.\n* 1 beer, 1 unit just as I drink it does: this.\n* 1 shot, on its own, no insulin, does: this\n\nAnd so on. It's a little hit or miss. But you'll build your own little library of alcohol affects you. There are generalizations of how alcohol affects T1s. They are generalizations, not universal truths. Hard liquor with no mixers doesn't affect me, nor does white wine. Beer does, and the hoppier/darker it is, the more it does. Insulin required, and no, it doesn't drop me afterwards.\n\nIf your parents are cool with it, do the experiment and note taking with them present; that might help them trust you a bit more. If they're not, find your most responsible trustworthy friend and do it with him. Have glucose and insulin nearby and make sure he or she knows the difference.\n\nAt some point you're going to fuck up. Practice your apology speech now.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> It\u2019s not that dangerous, you have a CGM.

No one that age can pace themselves and it goes off the rails very easily. Beer is awesome. \n\nDon\u2019t take insulin for any drinks you have. Have low sugar snacks on hand. \n\nIt\u2019s always better to be slightly high than it is to be super low while drinking. Give yourself a buffer. You can always take insulin if you\u2019re running high towards the end of the night. \n\nYou\u2019ll learn how to handle it, folks go way overboard with this, it\u2019s not that complicated. You don\u2019t need insulin for drinks unless you\u2019re smashing a bunch of sugary alcoholic drinks, which, don\u2019t do that. Jack and regular coke? Don\u2019t. Orange juice and vodka?

You\u2019ll fill up with liquid faster so physically won\u2019t be able to drink as much (good for learning how much alcohol your body can handle, and acclimating your body to alcohol). 2.

Drinking too much can spike your sugars like crazy, and then while you're hungover drop like crazy, and when you feeling like dog turds after having a few too many, it's harder to stay on top of actually taking care of yourself, it's not worth it. I wish I could tell my younger self to cool it drinking heavily with peers, having fun and imbibing is not a competition, enjoy your time with friends without thinking you need to drink *all* the drinks. If cannabis is kind to you, it's more fun blazing instead of tying too many on, you won't lose your wits/senses like you will with alcohol.

I googled for answers to no avail. I am an organ donor, but I wondered if there\u2019s a way to reserve my pancreas for my son to receive when I die? Just curious how I would even go about it.\n\nWe are the same blood type, btw.</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> His pancreas still does some jobs. If he were to receive yours, he would trade T1d for immunosuppressants. Most people don\u2019t find that trade off to be worth it. Usually, the people who get pancreas transplants are already getting something else transplanted, like a liver. Since they will require immunosuppressants anyway, the trade off is worth it.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> Pancreas transplants are fairly rare, difficult to pull off, and generally only offer a short term benefit.  The immunosuppressants required are probably worse than controlling T1.  If I remember correctly even those with successful transplants have a 50% chance of being back on insulin at five years.  It's a lovely thought to have your kid get your pancreas but it's not really a solution.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> The average lifespan of a transplanted pancreas is 10 years. The younger he is when he has a transplant, the more likely he will need more than 1.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> Pancreas transplants aren't really a viable method of treating diabetes, and is considered a last resort option. Transplants don't last forever, and some don't even last a year. Even if your son got lucky he'd probably only survive a decade or two after getting a transplant. The half life of pancreas transplants is 11 years, meaning in half of patients who have them the transplant fails before 11 years, and half fail after. As far as I can tell, the record for the longest surviving pancreas transplant is 24 years. \n\nType one can be managed for a lifetime, and we're closer and closer to a cure all the time. Your kid has a better chance just living with diabetes and hoping for a cure to be finished than trying to get an unnecessary transplant. I don't want to get your hopes up, but with where we are now it's pretty likely a cure will be possible by the time he is an adult.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> Aside from the drawbacks noted by others, you didn't say where you live. It's a bit hard to advise when nobody knows what laws might be applicable in your jurisdiction.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 6:</b> It\u2019s more than just immunosuppressive issues. His pancreas is perfectly fine. T1D isn\u2019t a pancreas issue, it\u2019s and antibody issue. His body is literally attacking the beta cells in the pancreas, causing the pancreas to have issues. He won\u2019t lose the antibodies he has because there was an organ donor. People don\u2019t really do transplants because it\u2019s highly likely the body will eventually attack the new pancreas. There has to be some sort of antibody treatment and immunosuppressive along with the transplant. \n\nMost the new trials for pancreas treatment are actually trying to find a way to make the antibodies mission of killing the pancreas unsuccessful. When doing so the pancreas should go back to normal and beta cells will work again.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 7:</b> Immunosupressants will be needed. I am not a medical professional but your kid's immune system might think that your pancreas is also a threat so the trade off is not worth it. If they are doing fine without it, then don't let them have the misfortune of a very weak immune system that can cause more issues.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 8:</b> I would strongly advise against pancreatic dontations as a treatment for T1D unless a doctor recommends it for two specific reasons:\n\nOrgan transplantation is a serious surgery generally considered a last resort for people with major complications or severely brittle diabetes with complications. This is because receiving an organ through transplanting then requires the receiver to take immunoupressants for life to prevent rejection. This puts them at risk for any number of infections and other medical problems.\n\nTransplantation also does not gaurantee their immune system won't once again attack and destory the islet cells that make insulin. In many cases, a new pancreas only \"cures\" someone from needing injected insulin for a short period of time.\n\nI woukd recommend talking to your doctor about this option. It's unfortunately not the miracle cure it is sometimes believed to be, absent an emergency situation.<br><br>\n", "label_annotations": {"no_claim": {"No claim detected.": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 24s "}}

I actually use sleep mode instead when exercising and it\u2019s great because it doesn\u2019t give the autoboluses.

If I\u2019m doing intense cardio, I crash really hard really fast. When I first got type one, I would have to be at 250-300 in order to exercise and not crash. My old pump had a setting where you could lower your basal rate by whatever percentage before exercising. That works perfect because I would just take 50% for the hour before. That way I wouldn\u2019t climb too high before or crash during. Because tandem has the control IQ, it automatically corrects me when I\u2019m trying to raise my blood sugar before exercising. It\u2019s super frustrating. I have to turn it off for at least a half hour before exercising. The Exercise Activity setting is useless. I have figured out that breaking my exercise into smaller chunks, like two brisk 30 minute walks a day, is much better- or I will under dose a meal and exercise right after. If I want to do a full hour of cardio, then I usually turn off my pump for 30 minutes before I don\u2019t restart it until 30 to 45 minutes into exercising. I\u2019m not sure which is better- The ups and downs your blood sugar goes through when exercising, or just doing gentle forms of exercise that don\u2019t change your blood sugar but don\u2019t always help with your cardiovascular health.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 6:</b> For me, it really depends on how much insulin on board I have. Running increases seems to at least double my insulin sensitivity. I try to aim for 1 unit or less of IOB before I start. If I am high before, I only take half my normal correction.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 7:</b> Running especially would tank me. What finally worked for me was lowering my basal by 50% about 30 mins before the run and down to 30% before heading out the door. If I had any insulin on board, I would have a light snack (a clementine and some pb for example). I also made sure I had some glucose gels while on my run. \n\nThere was a lot of trial and error and shorter runs to figure this out. Don\u2019t get discouraged! You can do it. \n\nAlso, control iq isn\u2019t for everyone. I also have a dexcom and tslim. While I love them, I do a better job than control iq (it\u2019s not aggressive enough for me).<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 8:</b> For me, running in the morning (before breakfast) requires almost no adjustment.  But I can't really do mornings, so in the afternoon, I only run 3 hours after a meal, do a 50 percent basal for 1 hour, and drink a cup of Gatorade right before going out.

I have started replacing carb heavy meals (more than 60g carbs) with low carb alternatives so for example for tea today I ate.\n\n- 80g Brussel sprouts\n- 80g Carrots\n- 80g Broccoli\n- 80g cauliflower\n- 200g chicken\n\nNow the carbohydrates of this meal added up to around 15g carbs. I also add mint sauce and mix it in for flavour so that is like an extra 5-10g carbs.\n\nSo for this meal I take 3 units of Novo-rapid insulin. I have this meal a few times per week however I always notice that my blood sugar levels will rise from around 5.6mmol/L(100.8Mg/dl) to 12(216Mg/dl), about 3 hours later, needing me to take a correction. (Estimation but it always rises a bit)\n\nI've looked at the carb content time and time again and meticiously measured them and they are bang on. I know my insulin sensitivity is ok because when I eat porridge for breakfast my blood sugar goes fine.\n\nSo I guess my question is, is there a way to Protein count in diet? Similar to the way we carb count, as I imagine it's the chickens fault? As well as the veg which I think contain protein too.\n\n\nThanks all.\nDan</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> Trial and error basically. If 3 units raises it, then try 4.5 or 5.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> Hey Dan, fellow UK based T1D here. Are you on a pump? Before I got my pump, my Dr (who works alongside Dr Bernstein and is a massive fan of low carb for t1d) put me on a 'slower acting' insulin just to take for high protein, low carb meals. IIRC it was pig insulin! If I have a lower carb meal now, I take an extended bolus that stops the spike but doesn't cause me to go low.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> I had a similar problem to you when i also started low carb (blood sugar rising 3 hours later) and am also currently on novorapid. My workaround at the moment is to give myself some units 1p minutes before i start eating (usually 2 to 4) and then some more units 2 hours later to account for the protein (also usually 2 units, but depends on how much protein i ate.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> The Type one diabetes Juicebox podcast has some of the best information on this and so much more!

I bolus for carbs and veggies up front, then I bolus about 2 hours later for the protein. Trial and error, honestly. And different types of protein will raise you differently so it will take practice but generally the protein rise comes 2-3 hours after a meal so you\u2019ll need to plan for it then.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 6:</b> I use regular Insulin and a bit fast acting insulin to cover protein and low-carb meals.<br><br>\n", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 1701, "end": 1864, "span": "my Dr (who works alongside Dr Bernstein and is a massive fan of low carb for t1d) put me on a 'slower acting' insulin just to take for high protein, low carb meals", "annotation": "verifiable claim"}], "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 9s "}}

I have never drank before but I would like to be able to drink with my friends. I understand that drinking can be very dangerous. I have a cgm and a pump and I am using the loop app to manage BG. I read that hard liquor can lower blood sugars, how does that work? Can I get around this by just lowering my basal and not worrying about it? How do I drink safely with T1D?</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> (Assuming 16 is the legal drinking age in your country)\n\neat a meal before you start drinking, preferably with a glass of water. \n\nknow what a serving of alcohol is no matter the type of alcohol,\n\nno more than 1 serving of alcohol per hour,\n\nalways have a designated driver, I also make sure people know to call 911 if I can't be woken they are not allowed to use my insulin on me.\n\nI drink sugary mixed drinks because I find that drinking lowers my blood sugar enough that my sugary mixed drinks keep me up, but I have to keep something next to the bed, because I usually go low before I wake up the next day. The only way to know how alcohol affects you personally is to keep your CGM close at all times.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> When your liver is processing alcohol, it will stop releasing glucose. If you still have basal insulin running at the normal rate, than your blood sugar will drop. There are different strategies for handling this. Lowering your basal rate and/or having a closed loop system do it for you is helpful. Make sure to never drink on an empty stomach. Be mindful that some alcoholic drinks have a lot of sugar and you may not need to bolus as much as you would for a nonalcoholic version of that same drink. Basically, a lot of trial and error. Keep an eye on your blood sugar.  And drink plenty of water. Cheers!<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> At your age: make sure your parents are OK with it. Seriously. Because if it goes wrong - and at some stage, it will - they need to know what's been going on and not be guessing. Trust me on this. It may have saved my life when I was 17 and stupid.\n\nHave food on board. Don't be alone. Try, if you can, to avoid drinking to excess. Experiment, slowly. I don't mean outrageous mixes, I mean:\n\n* 1 beer on its own, no insulin does: this.\n* 1 beer, 1 unit just as I drink it does: this.\n* 1 shot, on its own, no insulin, does: this\n\nAnd so on. It's a little hit or miss. But you'll build your own little library of alcohol affects you. There are generalizations of how alcohol affects T1s. They are generalizations, not universal truths. Hard liquor with no mixers doesn't affect me, nor does white wine. Beer does, and the hoppier/darker it is, the more it does. Insulin required, and no, it doesn't drop me afterwards.\n\nIf your parents are cool with it, do the experiment and note taking with them present; that might help them trust you a bit more. If they're not, find your most responsible trustworthy friend and do it with him. Have glucose and insulin nearby and make sure he or she knows the difference.\n\nAt some point you're going to fuck up. Practice your apology speech now.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> It\u2019s not that dangerous, you have a CGM. People here seem to forget diabetes and drinking has been around a hell of a lot longer than CGMs have. I highly disagree with bringing other people into the fold beyond \u201chey I\u2019m diabetic, if I ask for sugar bring me sugar\u201d but to each their own. \n\nDon\u2019t do straight liquor or hunch punch that some dude made for the party. No one that age can pace themselves and it goes off the rails very easily. Beer is awesome. \n\nDon\u2019t take insulin for any drinks you have. Have low sugar snacks on hand. \n\nIt\u2019s always better to be slightly high than it is to be super low while drinking. Give yourself a buffer. You can always take insulin if you\u2019re running high towards the end of the night. \n\nYou\u2019ll learn how to handle it, folks go way overboard with this, it\u2019s not that complicated. You don\u2019t need insulin for drinks unless you\u2019re smashing a bunch of sugary alcoholic drinks, which, don\u2019t do that. Jack and regular coke? Don\u2019t. Orange juice and vodka? Don\u2019t. Have low supplies and play it safe with a buffer.

A shot of straight vodka has the same effect for me as a regular soda. But it lasts longer\n\nThe only safer way to drink is start slow, in the safety of your own home, with both high and low supplies and preferably either on your own or with a friend or two.\n\nThe more calm and alert you are to your diabetes while drinking, for the first time, the better. \n\nFinding out how you'll respond at a raging party is not a good idea. \n\nBut, testing the waters on your own can help you during those parties.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 8:</b> Don't drink for the first time while out with freinds. Do it at home with your parents present until you learned how  your body handle alchohol and drinks of different sugar and carb levels.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 9:</b> When I first started drinking (and continuing drinking all night) I used to drink one alcoholic drink, and then a pint of water. I alternated between booze and water until I got older and more experienced with booze.\n\nI would definitely recommend this for anyone, for a number of reasons. 1. You\u2019ll fill up with liquid faster so physically won\u2019t be able to drink as much (good for learning how much alcohol your body can handle, and acclimating your body to alcohol). 2. You\u2019ll be that one annoying prick in the morning who wakes up after a night out with no hangover \ud83d\ude02\n\nI\u2019ve learnt over the years that shots, spirits, liquor, just don\u2019t do my body any favours. This isn\u2019t diabetes related, just me not being able to stomach strong alcohol.\n\nThe advice about sticking to beer is good, as it can be gassy, and fills you up quicker, so you physically can\u2019t drink as much alcohol. Same sort of deal as the drinking water in between.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 10:</b> I measured how many milliliters are in my average mouthful. For me 1 gulp is about 50 mL and a sip is about 25 mL. I took different sized mouthfuls of water and spat them into a bowl on my food scale. Did that enough times to find my average. \nWhen I drink i know how much carbs are per 100mL and the math is pretty simple, just need to keep track of how many sips/gulps u take. I have a scoreboard of how much i drank in my head that i can visualize.\n\nThis is also a good hack for if you need to correct a low with a beverage and you dont have any measuring cups\u203c\ufe0f\n\nWith beer and hard cider i bolus per usual. With hard alcohol i always eat something with it and bolus around 70% of what i usually would(for carbs in food and alcohol combined) For wine i bolus for 25% of the carbs but dont need to eat while drinkinkg (although i usually am lol).\n\nI always eat a handful of nuts and chocolate chips before going to bed after drinking bc its a good fat:carb:protein ratio for me<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 11:</b> I was diagnosed at 16, 20 yrs ago. I felt the need to feel *normal* and do normal teen stuff. You can have fun, but please utilize your CGM and don't feed the urge to keep pushing things. I drank in college too, and sometimes I wonder how I didn't die. Drinking too much can spike your sugars like crazy, and then while you're hungover drop like crazy, and when you feeling like dog turds after having a few too many, it's harder to stay on top of actually taking care of yourself, it's not worth it. I wish I could tell my younger self to cool it drinking heavily with peers, having fun and imbibing is not a competition, enjoy your time with friends without thinking you need to drink *all* the drinks. If cannabis is kind to you, it's more fun blazing instead of tying too many on, you won't lose your wits/senses like you will with alcohol. Having fun and exploring is a part of growing up, but please be kind to yourself and please take advantage of the info your CGM provides in this time of discovery. Be safe and trust your common sense!<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 12:</b> Assume that you need less insulin when you have been drinking.

My old pump had a setting where you could lower your basal rate by whatever percentage before exercising. That works perfect because I would just take 50% for the hour before.

It\u2019s super frustrating. I have to turn it off for at least a half hour before exercising. The Exercise Activity setting is useless. I have figured out that breaking my exercise into smaller chunks, like two brisk 30 minute walks a day, is much better- or I will under dose a meal and exercise right after.

UK resident here and I would like to hopefully get some help from friends on this sub.\n\nRecently I've decided I want to start eating healthy, had a bit of a spell of eating so many bags of crisps and choccy bars lol. I have started replacing carb heavy meals (more than 60g carbs) with low carb alternatives so for example for tea today I ate.\n\n- 80g Brussel sprouts\n- 80g Carrots\n- 80g Broccoli\n- 80g cauliflower\n- 200g chicken\n\nNow the carbohydrates of this meal added up to around 15g carbs. I also add mint sauce and mix it in for flavour so that is like an extra 5-10g carbs.\n\nSo for this meal I take 3 units of Novo-rapid insulin. I have this meal a few times per week however I always notice that my blood sugar levels will rise from around 5.6mmol/L(100.8Mg/dl) to 12(216Mg/dl), about 3 hours later, needing me to take a correction. (Estimation but it always rises a bit)\n\nI've looked at the carb content time and time again and meticiously measured them and they are bang on. I know my insulin sensitivity is ok because when I eat porridge for breakfast my blood sugar goes fine.\n\nSo I guess my question is, is there a way to Protein count in diet? Similar to the way we carb count, as I imagine it's the chickens fault? As well as the veg which I think contain protein too.\n\n\nThanks all.\nDan</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> Trial and error basically.

Before I got my pump, my Dr (who works alongside Dr Bernstein and is a massive fan of low carb for t1d) put me on a 'slower acting' insulin just to take for high protein, low carb meals. IIRC it was pig insulin! If I have a lower carb meal now, I take an extended bolus that stops the spike but doesn't cause me to go low.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> I had a similar problem to you when i also started low carb (blood sugar rising 3 hours later) and am also currently on novorapid.
