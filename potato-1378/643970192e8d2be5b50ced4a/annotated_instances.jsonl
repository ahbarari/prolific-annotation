I\u2019m trying to understand this because from what I read on the internet calculating my insulin in take purely based on the carb amount I take is not correct and there are other things to include. Like fiber, protein etc.\n\nI\u2019m 28 y old and I have diabetes for 26 years. Previously I didn\u2019t need to count carbs because my life was very stabile. But now I\u2018m more active, like going to gym, eating outside with friends, work etc. So my eating habits and my life style changed a lot. So I\u2018m now more curious because for example this morning around 10-11 AM my glucose levels were around 120+ and I ate 2 slices of bread which each slice contains 26g carbs, a mix of eggs, tomato, onion and paprika food, some cheese, olive and butter. I took 4 units before and 2 units an hour later. Logically it should have been enough but after 3 hours my glucose levels were around 300 and I took 2 more units and it still going up.\n\nSo in general I am very confused and I want to understand better how should I calculate detailly my insulin need and what to consider or if there are any apps that would help me calculate insulin need better I would like to learn them. Like for example an app considers everything like protein, fiber and tells me this is how much I need or if someone here could tell me or provide me a source it would be great.\n\nThanks.</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> Waltzing the dragon has a formula for calculating fat and protein and the juicebox podcast has an episode on it. There is also an app called insulin calculator black square with blue circle that calculates for f&p. I havent compared it to doing the formula myself though. Experiment with your carb ratios as well.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> The entire 11 years I\u2019ve had type one Ive had an endocrinologist/diabetes specialist work out my ratios. I know there are ways of working it out yourself but my personal opinion is to trust a professional. Then again, I am in the UK and get my healthcare free and I know that\u2019s not the same for everyone. Just make sure that, if you have to work it out yourself, you do it safely and start small so you don\u2019t give yourself too much insulin. Take care of yourself!<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> I know this is not what you asked (sorry!), but how long do you take your insulin before you eat? I use novarapid and find taking it about 10 - 15 mins before most meals helps stop the spike in the first place. I think the time varies from person to person though and also the exact meal (like I know high fat slows down my digestion a lot).\n\nHaving said that, I know newer insulins such as fiasp start working more quickly and so you don't have to take them so far in advanced.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> learn about the glycemic index. sometimes you have to split up the dose throughout the duration of the meal absorption. the amount of insulin you need for basal, carb ratios, isf, etc will change throughout your life. we will always have to make adjustments.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> Make sure to dose 15 min before eating. Don\u2019t forget onions have significant carbs. Looks like you used 1:15 ish ratio initially- 60carb/4. Try giving all 6 units up front as 1:10. You need more insulin up front to stop the rise. It might take more than that even.

My nana on my mother\u2019s side at the age of 35. Here\u2019s the thing, I am 22 years old and I\u2019ve just been diagnosed with celiac disease. I found out online that T1D is much more prevalent in people with celiac. I was already worried I will develop it one day, but now I\u2019m extra worried. Since I have several risk factors, does anyone know just how likely it is that I will develop T1D? I found the risk factors for development with celiac disease & for having a parent with T1D, but nothing about both together. Pls let me know if I\u2019m posting in the wrong sub for this. I hope you\u2019re all doing well!!! :)</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> Google trialnet. Depending on your age you are eligible for free risk screening.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> I wouldn't overly worry about it. It might happen and it might not. My advice is to get a glucose reader and do a quick test every so often, especially if you get any of the symptoms<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> If your father has T1 then you have a 1 in 17 chance of getting it.\n\nhttps://www.diabetes.org/diabetes/genetics-diabetes\n\nI don't know the statistics regarding celiac, but I think you might be misunderstanding this fact a bit. I don't think there's anything special about celiac as it relates to T1. Having ANY autoimmune disease makes you much more likely than the average person to have a second autoimmune disease. So that probably does make your odds somewhat worse than 1 in 17, but I couldn't say how much worse.\n\nStill though I wouldn't worry about it as there's nothing you can do to prevent it anyway - it will either happen or it won't. You can get tested if you like to see if you carry the gene that increases your risk of developing it. Otherwise all you can do is be aware of the symptoms and check yourself periodically so it can at least be caught early if it does happen.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> The age that your family members developed diabetes is quite late, and points to Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults (LADA), which occurs most often in ppl over the age of 30.  It is not typical T1D, as it progresses at a much slower rate, even though the end treatment is the same (insulin reliance).  You can do some research on LADA, and there are antibody tests that are used to confirm its diagnosis, but I\u2019m not sure if the tests can be used to predict your likelihood of developing it.  Some ppl on this sub have rather strong opinions about LADA vs T1D, so they may offer more info about it.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> My dad got it at 28.  His sister got it late 30s.  I got it at 46.  My siblings in their mid 40s don't have it.  I never knew I had a 1/17 chance.  I never worried about it.

It may not be as much a matter of making them feel better as a matter of making you feel better, because when we are experiencing highs and lows, our emotional reactions often make zero sense. So if you have access and understanding that there is a higher low going on, you can try )though it\u2019s not easy) and understand that their behavior whether it\u2019s acting short, tempered or \u201cdrunk\u201d (lows) or whatever is a product of biology and not a choice.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> Calm walks have a tendency to help with high blood sugars, though need to be careful to not drop low (which exercise sometimes causes).
