It was still romantic, despite the one billion children in the restaurant. \n\nWhile deciding what to order, I came across milkshakes. And I haven't had a milkshake since 2017, when I was diagnosed with t1. My boyfriend asked me if I can actually drink that, since I've told him that I can't drink sugary stuff (unless they contain alcohol, hallelujah) and I realised I'd never asked my dietician about that. So I drank coke zero instead, and I'm getting really tired of that. So so SO tired of coke zero. \n\nCan I have milkshakes? Because honestly I miss milkshakes so much. They're my guilty pleasure. I need them back in my life. How do pen users take enough insulin for milkshakes? Is milkshake on the list of \"forbidden snacks\"?\n\nPlease keep yourselves from preaching your low carb, keto, Mars soil only diets and whatnot. I'm struggling to stay above the underweight limit. A change in diet is not what I need right now. Thank you for your understanding.</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> Rejoice! Drink a shake!  Now, not all shakes are created equal. McDonald's vanilla shakes (small) tip the scale at nearly 80g of carbs!  So, just be sure to calculate the appropriate units of your fast-acting insulin.\n\nAnd happy Valentine's Day to you and your boyfriend! \u2764\ufe0f\ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> how have you had diabetes for 3 years and not know that you can drink sugary things? you sweet summer child. you can have whatever you want as long as you count the carbs and take the correct amount of insulin!<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> Short answer. Yes...\n\nI use a pump so I handle milkshakes and stuff differently. \n\nBut! For sugary drinks like that, if I had to inject, I would prebolus at least 20 minutes in advance. Then freely drink it. That way I make sure the insulin is acting in me and dropping me, at the same time stay in range by drinking the milkshake<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> Go ahead a splurge! Just make sure you dose for it. My son gets a treat once a month and it\u2019s all trial and error. Some are harder to figure out than others but you won\u2019t know until you try. Happy Valentines Day!<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> You came here to ask if you can have a milkshake but literally banned people against high sugar items from answering, so, you just wanted people to validate your decision, so drink the milkshake. Liquid sugar is extremely hard to bolus for you\u2019re gonna need to watch yourself carefully. Good luck.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 6:</b> I remember feeling like that for the first few years after my diagnosis.  Drink the milkshake, just monitor a little more than normal if you don\u2019t have a cgm.  You may need to take the insulin in split doses since you mentioned you are on pens, but you can responsibly have a milkshake.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 7:</b> Mini shakes from sonic are a serious weakness of mine - they\u2019re small enough that the carb load isn\u2019t too insane \ud83d\udc4d<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 8:</b> A traditional ice cream shake from McDonalds can be 60-100 grams of carbs: https://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en-us/product/vanilla-shake-large.html (toggle the sizes) can you? Yes.\n\nDo you want to eat 1/2-2/3 of your daily carb load in one item? It's not a good idea, but you can. \n\nInterestingly enough, because of the fat content, it will not spike as badly, but it will spike for longer (order of 5-6 hours as opposed to 2). Sugary soda (no fat) spikes it higher, faster - in some ways, it is more dangerous.<br><br>\n", "label_annotations": {"no_claim": {"No claim detected.": "1"}}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 1590, "end": 1787, "span": "had diabetes for 3 years and not know that you can drink sugary things? you sweet summer child. you can have whatever you want as long as you count the carbs and take the correct amount of insulin!", "annotation": "verifiable claim"}], "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 19s "}}

And how much is considered a \u201cnormal range\u201d?\nGenuinely curious about this one. I\u2019ve been type 1 for almost 4 years now, and still learning more about it everyday. \n\nA little backstory as to why I\u2019m interested in this question; since I\u2019ve been diagnosed with t1, I\u2019ve been hospitalized with DKA a few times. Each time the hospital treats it and later give me food and insulin, they would only give me like 4-6 units of insulin with my meals. My normal dosage outside of the hospital is like 12-14.  Is there a reason the hospital would only give me very little? The last time I was treated in the hospital I spoke up about it and told them that I needed more insulin or my blood sugar would just go up again. Has anything similar happened to you?</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> The way it works is generally like this - if your endocrinologist or whoever writes your prescription for insulin isn\u2019t consulted and therefore isn\u2019t putting in orders, the attending hospitalist or the endo on call uses a formula based on the range of your age and weight to determine your dose and correction factor/sliding scale.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> I haven't experienced anything like that, but I usually average  40 units a day, and I just switched pumps, and had to up my basal 60 percent, so I think a normal range depends on the diabetic?<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> An acquaintance nurse tells me that sliding scale is a normal practice since the majority of diabetic patients they have are type 2. It seems really dumb that people with access to experts wouldn't try harder but healthcare in America is generally not great.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> That\u2019s odd though, the times my son has gone in, they always ask what his carb/ratio is and they go by it. He\u2019s 1:10<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> The sliding scale ratio is to prevent your body from going into shock. If your coming off DKA bringing back your normal bg range should be done slowly rather than all at once. If it were treated all at once and your body did go into shock you would feel low symptoms for high bgs. I asked about this when I went into DKA and my nurse was amazing with helping me understand what was happening and walked me through the process of my treatment. I have been a type 1 diabetic for 3 years now and have kept it under control for the most part. I find if I'm having a high day to have less carbs and if I spike I will go for a run or throw on a workout video from youtube to help me bring it down. It's mostly knowing what your body needs and finding a balance with your ratios that work for you. I would talk to your doctor about switching ratios with your long acting insulin rather than increasing your meal time insulin if your usually high before meals and are doing a lot of correcting.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 6:</b> My opinion - endos can be trusted to give a decent starting point for basal and bolus doses, but it\u2019s up to each of us to really dial it in properly.\n\nMy endo started me at 4 units twice a day.

It was still romantic, despite the one billion children in the restaurant. \n\nWhile deciding what to order, I came across milkshakes. And I haven't had a milkshake since 2017, when I was diagnosed with t1. My boyfriend asked me if I can actually drink that, since I've told him that I can't drink sugary stuff (unless they contain alcohol, hallelujah) and I realised I'd never asked my dietician about that. So I drank coke zero instead, and I'm getting really tired of that. So so SO tired of coke zero. \n\nCan I have milkshakes? Because honestly I miss milkshakes so much. They're my guilty pleasure. I need them back in my life. How do pen users take enough insulin for milkshakes?

Yes...\n\nI use a pump so I handle milkshakes and stuff differently. \n\nBut! For sugary drinks like that, if I had to inject, I would prebolus at least 20 minutes in advance. Then freely drink it. That way I make sure the insulin is acting in me and dropping me, at the same time stay in range by drinking the milkshake<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> Go ahead a splurge! Just make sure you dose for it. My son gets a treat once a month and it\u2019s all trial and error. Some are harder to figure out than others but you won\u2019t know until you try. Happy Valentines Day!<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> You came here to ask if you can have a milkshake but literally banned people against high sugar items from answering, so, you just wanted people to validate your decision, so drink the milkshake.

And how much is considered a \u201cnormal range\u201d?\nGenuinely curious about this one. I\u2019ve been type 1 for almost 4 years now, and still learning more about it everyday. \n\nA little backstory as to why I\u2019m interested in this question; since I\u2019ve been diagnosed with t1, I\u2019ve been hospitalized with DKA a few times. Each time the hospital treats it and later give me food and insulin, they would only give me like 4-6 units of insulin with my meals. My normal dosage outside of the hospital is like 12-14.  Is there a reason the hospital would only give me very little? The last time I was treated in the hospital I spoke up about it and told them that I needed more insulin or my blood sugar would just go up again. Has anything similar happened to you?</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> The way it works is generally like this - if your endocrinologist or whoever writes your prescription for insulin isn\u2019t consulted and therefore isn\u2019t putting in orders, the attending hospitalist or the endo on call uses a formula based on the range of your age and weight to determine your dose and correction factor/sliding scale.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> I haven't experienced anything like that, but I usually average  40 units a day, and I just switched pumps, and had to up my basal 60 percent, so I think a normal range depends on the diabetic?<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> An acquaintance nurse tells me that sliding scale is a normal practice since the majority of diabetic patients they have are type 2. It seems really dumb that people with access to experts wouldn't try harder but healthcare in America is generally not great.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> That\u2019s odd though, the times my son has gone in, they always ask what his carb/ratio is and they go by it. He\u2019s 1:10<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> The sliding scale ratio is to prevent your body from going into shock. If your coming off DKA bringing back your normal bg range should be done slowly rather than all at once. If it were treated all at once and your body did go into shock you would feel low symptoms for high bgs. I asked about this when I went into DKA and my nurse was amazing with helping me understand what was happening and walked me through the process of my treatment. I have been a type 1 diabetic for 3 years now and have kept it under control for the most part. I find if I'm having a high day to have less carbs and if I spike I will go for a run or throw on a workout video from youtube to help me bring it down. It's mostly knowing what your body needs and finding a balance with your ratios that work for you. I would talk to your doctor about switching ratios with your long acting insulin rather than increasing your meal time insulin if your usually high before meals and are doing a lot of correcting.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 6:</b> My opinion - endos can be trusted to give a decent starting point for basal and bolus doses, but it\u2019s up to each of us to really dial it in properly.\n\nMy endo started me at 4 units twice a day.
