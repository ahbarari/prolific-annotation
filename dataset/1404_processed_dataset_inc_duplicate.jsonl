I also add mint sauce and mix it in for flavour so that is like an extra 5-10g carbs.\n\nSo for this meal I take 3 units of Novo-rapid insulin.

(Estimation but it always rises a bit)\n\nI've looked at the carb content time and time again and meticiously measured them and they are bang on. I know my insulin sensitivity is ok because when I eat porridge for breakfast my blood sugar goes fine.\n\nSo I guess my question is, is there a way to Protein count in diet?
