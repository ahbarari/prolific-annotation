I\u2019ve been having a hard time with going low during exercise. I\u2019ve already heard all the basic stuff like starting with a higher sugar and eating a snack in the middle of your exercise. I\u2019ll start playing tennis at 180, eat some skittles in like an hour, maybe drink a juice another hour after that, and still end up low to often. I usually play tennis for 3-4 hours so I always bring candy just in case but I\u2019m really getting tired of eating so much god dam junk. My levels are so unstable when I play. A few days ago I started at 330, and within the hour was at 52, no correction dose either. How can I keep stable sugars while playing? Could eating some longer chain carbohydrates that take longer to break down help?</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> Try to exercise with very little to no insulin on board. For me this was either exercising early in the morning when I just woke up or waking up pretty early (7am) having breakfast and bolusing as normal but then only exercising at 11am.\n\nTry figure out when your insulin peaks, my insulin always brings down my blood sugar drastically at 1hr 30 mins - 2 hr after bolusing. Because of this I try exercise 2hr 30 mins - 3hr after my last bolus. \n\nGoodluck man, it\u2019s great you\u2019re exercising \ud83d\ude00<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> I\u2019ve found that sometimes I can prevent a low during exercise if I add some protein before I workout, like a hard boiled egg. As you suggested a more complex carb might also help stabilize your bg, like bread. Can\u2019t guarantee sadly, but might be worth a try. Sorry it has been such a nuisance, it\u2019s awesome you keep at it despite the lows.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> Aerobic exercise (cardio, which tennis is) will burn sugar. Anaerobic workout requiring muscular bursts (weight training, HIIT, etc) will create stress, this a release of muscle energy from the body, glucagon, to fuel those muscles. That generally makes our b.s. rise.\n\nVery little/ no insulin on board should help. DEF eat complex carbs and some fat before workout. I knock back sugar in the raw packets as needed - measurable , quick dissolve, and free at any coffee house. My life is littered with them in cars, purses, etc.\nBIGGEST TIP: Follow Lauren Bongiorno with Risely - she is on IG and has a very informative podcast. She's a beast for workouts so she really knows a lot, and almost NEVER drops in extended aerobic workout \ud83d\udcaa<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> Before heading out for a longer run (above 15miles) I would make sure there was little to no insulin on board then eat a peanut butter & banana sandwich before heading out. Yes my sugars would rise but they never went above 180; I\u2019d also make sure I had some energy gels with carbs in them in me plus the obligatory sweets (my go to were jelly babies but I\u2019m the UK so no sure what the US equivalent is sorry). Also be ready for the later hypo that can happen a few hours after exercise but usually a nice carby meal takes care of that (mine was always a bowl of porridge). \n\nA little tip I learned from my diabetes nurse & bizarrely it does work; if I was heading downwards do a quick burst of very intense running and it does bring your sugars up! No idea of the science behind it but it works!<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> Right: you have a good basis, but it\u2019s not actually the best thing to do here, (it\u2019s not your fault, and I\u2019m not blaming you, you just need to readjust)\n\n1. Do you take basal morning or evening, or both? If it\u2019s both or morning, consider taking a unit less on days you plan to exercise.\n\n2. Timing is important. When you tennis, how long has it been since you took your bolus (short acting)? If you eat breakfast and immediately go to play, you will need way less insulin at that meal than if you eat breakfast at 8 but don\u2019t go out to play until 11. Short acting peaks at about 2 ish hours and lasts 4-5, so it might be beneficial to try to nudge your exercise routine to the end of it\u2019s effectiveness, not the beginning. \n\nIf that\u2019s not an option (which sometimes it\u2019s not), you need to be taking less insulin at the meal before sports. Have they covered carb counting and insulin to carb ratios yet? Because that\u2019s quite important. (I have more information on this if you wish to have it)\n\n3. I would also recommend the snacks be less high on the GI scale, and also changing when you take them. \n\nYou have skittles and juice, both of which are basically just pure sugar. I think it would be better if you could add something that raises you slower as well. \n\nFor me, when I\u2019m swimming, I have fruit (usually mango or grapes) about 20 minutes before I start swimming. About 12 grams carbs. Right before I go in, I have two glucose tablets (8grams carbs). I generally end up starting at 8-9 mmol (144-162) and then finishing at 7-8 mmol (108-144). Which is pretty solid. Fruit and milk and fruity yogurts are all healthier options than skittles. Maybe you could try adding them instead?\n\nKeep juice on hand, and have some right before you start, because the fruit/yogurts won\u2019t kick in until about 45 mins after you eat it, because the fibre/fats slow down the absorption of the carbs. You\u2019ll still need some fast acting most likely, but at least you won\u2019t be downing a lot (100ml apple juice is about 11 grams carbs, which is probably the amount I\u2019d start with)<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 6:</b> Check out diabetes training camp teen camp. You\u2019ll get a ton out of it and Dr Matt will set you up for long term success.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 7:</b> I exercise in the AM when I am more insulin resistant. I have something with protein and fat to keep me stable with no short acting for it. Sometimes this is coffee and cream or a peanut butter sandwhich (depending on how low I am). If it is really intense, then I might add a juice.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 8:</b> I assume that you aren\u2019t pumping.  On advantage of a pump is turning down basal while exercising.. or just removing it.  This is like not having any long acting bringing you down during exercise.  \nThe other approach possible if using something like lantus is a split dose night and morning\u2026run a reduced long acting during active days.   The disadvantage is you will run higher before and after workouts. And if you cancel workouts you\u2019ll run real high.\n\nGood luck<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 9:</b> The key is to have a lower basal rate during physical activity. If you're MDI, plan a day in advance and lower the basal. If you're on pump, it's much easier to manage. I have 6 basal rates that I select to match what I'm doing next and I select it BEFORE I begin. For tennis and long bike rides, I have peanut butter and jelly sandwiches plus dates with walnuts. I never eat empty calories.\n\nYou might enjoy reading about Bill Talbert, the first diabetic tennis (and Davis Cup) player. He developed his net game so he could limit lows by reducing running back and forth across the baseline... His life inspired me to take up tennis after diagnosis at age 13 in 1965. I still play tennis, ride a bike etc., and use a sensor, pump, with iPhone/Apple Watch. For me, this is the closest thing to a cure until there is one and avoid unexpected lows. My last 7 year average A1c is 5.6 (range 5.4-5.9) without hypoglycemia.\n\nWith Joy and Radiance, Live Long and Prosper<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 10:</b> Sugar is bad at preventing lows, you need calories, not just sugar.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 11:</b> Everyone's T1D is unique, and it really takes time and effort to understand yours and get comfortable managing it.\n\nI *really* struggled with this when I first got diagnosed, in college.\n\nWhat insulin(s) and delivery system do you use? I'm on MDI.\n\nEating protiens,fats, and while wheats can help keep BG up for a period of evercise. Even very sugar rich things like sports drinks or candy bars may raise your sugar very high, but crash back down - the quick sugar rush.\n\nI split my basal in to two doses to avoid lows. After years I kind of found my equilibrium - I take a certain dose of basal, but I *need* to get a certain amount of exercise to keep sugars stable, otherwise they go up. Corrective doses, or even just a 20 minute walk around the block (properly timed) can keep them in check. \n\nI can take one full rest day before they will start to climb. If I know I'm going to be taking a few days off, I increase my basal 10%.\n\nI encourage you to be brave, and experiment (safely) with your body and your habits and find out what works for your diabetes. Keep snacks around.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 12:</b> Granola bars. Those do wonders. Get a higher carb box and a medium carb box. Eat one of the high ones 20 before, and then BC and evaluate after an hour. Tennis is really strenuous, so I would say start with a 30-35 carb bar.<br><br>\n", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 2395, "end": 2601, "span": "BIGGEST TIP: Follow Lauren Bongiorno with Risely - she is on IG and has a very informative podcast.

When I was doing injections I would just make a bottle of juice or diluted Gatorade and drink it slowly over the course of the exercise. \n\nThis is actually the primary reason I switched to an insulin pump. Mine (tslim) has an exercise mode which I turn on 1.5 to 2 hours before climbing or running and it slowly reduces the amount of basal insulin on board. Then I get waaay less lows which exercising.

I\u2019ve been having a hard time with going low during exercise. I\u2019ve already heard all the basic stuff like starting with a higher sugar and eating a snack in the middle of your exercise. I\u2019ll start playing tennis at 180, eat some skittles in like an hour, maybe drink a juice another hour after that, and still end up low to often. I usually play tennis for 3-4 hours so I always bring candy just in case but I\u2019m really getting tired of eating so much god dam junk. My levels are so unstable when I play. A few days ago I started at 330, and within the hour was at 52, no correction dose either. How can I keep stable sugars while playing? Could eating some longer chain carbohydrates that take longer to break down help?</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> Try to exercise with very little to no insulin on board. For me this was either exercising early in the morning when I just woke up or waking up pretty early (7am) having breakfast and bolusing as normal but then only exercising at 11am.\n\nTry figure out when your insulin peaks, my insulin always brings down my blood sugar drastically at 1hr 30 mins - 2 hr after bolusing. Because of this I try exercise 2hr 30 mins - 3hr after my last bolus. \n\nGoodluck man, it\u2019s great you\u2019re exercising \ud83d\ude00<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> I\u2019ve found that sometimes I can prevent a low during exercise if I add some protein before I workout, like a hard boiled egg. As you suggested a more complex carb might also help stabilize your bg, like bread. Can\u2019t guarantee sadly, but might be worth a try. Sorry it has been such a nuisance, it\u2019s awesome you keep at it despite the lows.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> Aerobic exercise (cardio, which tennis is) will burn sugar. Anaerobic workout requiring muscular bursts (weight training, HIIT, etc) will create stress, this a release of muscle energy from the body, glucagon, to fuel those muscles. That generally makes our b.s. rise.\n\nVery little/ no insulin on board should help. DEF eat complex carbs and some fat before workout. I knock back sugar in the raw packets as needed - measurable , quick dissolve, and free at any coffee house. My life is littered with them in cars, purses, etc.\nBIGGEST TIP: Follow Lauren Bongiorno with Risely - she is on IG and has a very informative podcast. She's a beast for workouts so she really knows a lot, and almost NEVER drops in extended aerobic workout \ud83d\udcaa<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> Before heading out for a longer run (above 15miles) I would make sure there was little to no insulin on board then eat a peanut butter & banana sandwich before heading out.

Also be ready for the later hypo that can happen a few hours after exercise but usually a nice carby meal takes care of that (mine was always a bowl of porridge). \n\nA little tip I learned from my diabetes nurse & bizarrely it does work; if I was heading downwards do a quick burst of very intense running and it does bring your sugars up! No idea of the science behind it but it works!<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> Right: you have a good basis, but it\u2019s not actually the best thing to do here, (it\u2019s not your fault, and I\u2019m not blaming you, you just need to readjust)\n\n1. Do you take basal morning or evening, or both? If it\u2019s both or morning, consider taking a unit less on days you plan to exercise.\n\n2. Timing is important. When you tennis, how long has it been since you took your bolus (short acting)? If you eat breakfast and immediately go to play, you will need way less insulin at that meal than if you eat breakfast at 8 but don\u2019t go out to play until 11. Short acting peaks at about 2 ish hours and lasts 4-5, so it might be beneficial to try to nudge your exercise routine to the end of it\u2019s effectiveness, not the beginning. \n\nIf that\u2019s not an option (which sometimes it\u2019s not), you need to be taking less insulin at the meal before sports. Have they covered carb counting and insulin to carb ratios yet? Because that\u2019s quite important. (I have more information on this if you wish to have it)\n\n3. I would also recommend the snacks be less high on the GI scale, and also changing when you take them. \n\nYou have skittles and juice, both of which are basically just pure sugar. I think it would be better if you could add something that raises you slower as well. \n\nFor me, when I\u2019m swimming, I have fruit (usually mango or grapes) about 20 minutes before I start swimming. About 12 grams carbs. Right before I go in, I have two glucose tablets (8grams carbs). I generally end up starting at 8-9 mmol (144-162) and then finishing at 7-8 mmol (108-144). Which is pretty solid. Fruit and milk and fruity yogurts are all healthier options than skittles. Maybe you could try adding them instead?\n\nKeep juice on hand, and have some right before you start, because the fruit/yogurts won\u2019t kick in until about 45 mins after you eat it, because the fibre/fats slow down the absorption of the carbs. You\u2019ll still need some fast acting most likely, but at least you won\u2019t be downing a lot (100ml apple juice is about 11 grams carbs, which is probably the amount I\u2019d start with)<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 6:</b> Check out diabetes training camp teen camp.

I have something with protein and fat to keep me stable with no short acting for it. Sometimes this is coffee and cream or a peanut butter sandwhich (depending on how low I am). If it is really intense, then I might add a juice.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 8:</b> I assume that you aren\u2019t pumping.  On advantage of a pump is turning down basal while exercising.. or just removing it.  This is like not having any long acting bringing you down during exercise.  \nThe other approach possible if using something like lantus is a split dose night and morning\u2026run a reduced long acting during active days.   The disadvantage is you will run higher before and after workouts. And if you cancel workouts you\u2019ll run real high.\n\nGood luck<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 9:</b> The key is to have a lower basal rate during physical activity. If you're MDI, plan a day in advance and lower the basal. If you're on pump, it's much easier to manage. I have 6 basal rates that I select to match what I'm doing next and I select it BEFORE I begin. For tennis and long bike rides, I have peanut butter and jelly sandwiches plus dates with walnuts. I never eat empty calories.\n\nYou might enjoy reading about Bill Talbert, the first diabetic tennis (and Davis Cup) player. He developed his net game so he could limit lows by reducing running back and forth across the baseline... His life inspired me to take up tennis after diagnosis at age 13 in 1965. I still play tennis, ride a bike etc., and use a sensor, pump, with iPhone/Apple Watch. For me, this is the closest thing to a cure until there is one and avoid unexpected lows. My last 7 year average A1c is 5.6 (range 5.4-5.9) without hypoglycemia.\n\nWith Joy and Radiance, Live Long and Prosper<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 10:</b> Sugar is bad at preventing lows, you need calories, not just sugar.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 11:</b> Everyone's T1D is unique, and it really takes time and effort to understand yours and get comfortable managing it.\n\nI *really* struggled with this when I first got diagnosed, in college.\n\nWhat insulin(s) and delivery system do you use? I'm on MDI.\n\nEating protiens,fats, and while wheats can help keep BG up for a period of evercise. Even very sugar rich things like sports drinks or candy bars may raise your sugar very high, but crash back down - the quick sugar rush.\n\nI split my basal in to two doses to avoid lows. After years I kind of found my equilibrium - I take a certain dose of basal, but I *need* to get a certain amount of exercise to keep sugars stable, otherwise they go up.

When I was doing injections I would just make a bottle of juice or diluted Gatorade and drink it slowly over the course of the exercise. \n\nThis is actually the primary reason I switched to an insulin pump. Mine (tslim) has an exercise mode which I turn on 1.5 to 2 hours before climbing or running and it slowly reduces the amount of basal insulin on board. Then I get waaay less lows which exercising. You can even have a different profile for carb/insulin ratios for after exercise which always helps me since I find I need like 20% less insulin for a meal after a hard work out.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 7:</b> I set a temp basal and eat some carbs, (90% reduction in basal and 15g of carbs) like others have said, don\u2019t work out right after a bolus because insulin on board will send you right down, I typically don\u2019t eat any carbs for lunch if I\u2019m going to surf after work.

But, not this high. And not this difficult to control. The vast majority of my insulin has been spent on corrections and basal. I never usually use this much insulin when I haven\u2019t been really eating much. My carb ratio is 10. So I\u2019ve only spent 6.1 units on food. (see picture above).

I don\u2019t know what the hell it did to me, but it was a shit show. I had to take probably 3x my normal insulin and be really careful about what I ate. I had to wake up like every 2 hours to make sure I wasn\u2019t running high. This probably lasted 2 days after I started antibiotics and then poof, things balanced out in like 12 hours. It was f\u2019ing weird. Sickness is a crapshoot. It\u2019s never been consistent with me in my 23 years of T1D. Welcome to diabetes, where shits never the same, and usually not predictable. I would monitor ketones (DKA is your worst enemy, so get some ketone strips from Walgreens/CVS/Walmart), keep up the corrections to ensure you don\u2019t spike really high, DRINK WATER (can\u2019t stress this enough, even with a sore throat, stay hydrated), make sure you continue to eat, and call your doctor in the morning. When things change dramatically like this, it\u2019s always good to consult with your endo and get advice.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> Yeah, so T1D disclaimer that they never mention is that ANYTIME you even feel sick, your sugars are going to go batshit. Ride out as best as possible.. and fevers make it a rollercoaster - as do bacterial infections (not so much the viral, which explains the Covid stuff) and antibiotics. Enjoy.

How does that work?</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> We need a little more info here, OP.  Are you on MDI or a pump?  Do you have a CGM?<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> They are probably going to ask you to reduce your basal insulin a bit before the surgery because doctors prefer you run a bit on the high side while they're working on you.   The good thing about wisdom teeth is that they heal-up pretty quickly so you will be able to drink and eat soft foods almost immediately afterwards.  \n\n\nI also have two follow-up questions:  Does your dentist know you're a Type 1?  Does your doctor / endo know you're getting your wisdom teeth done?  If the answer to either of these questions is \"no\", then you need to contact them and let them know because they will most likely have lots of good information to share with you and each other.  Good luck!<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> I'm confused by the question! The answer is: just like any human being having a surgery. You're only different because your pancreas does not produce enough/any insulin. That has nothing to do with surgery anywhere. I had all 4 horizontal wisdom teeth cut out many years ago in 2 surgeries, but each was day surgery and then back to work/home.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> Call your endo<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> I have been concious every time. With a wackload of freezing. Wisdom teeth (2 impacted), pulled infected molar/implant install, root canal and crowns. The infected tooth was the worth. Everything else was not too bad, just the sound of them breaking up the bones for the impacted teeth or having it pulled it really weird.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 6:</b> I made this several times on MDI. I don't think you need to reduce your basal tbd. The operation only takes a short time, a few minutes and you will probably get locally numbing. \n\nI would eat normally but at least 2 hours before the procedure and then maybe a small snack before to have stable blood sugars, maybe slightly higher than normal. \n\nIf you get low during the procedure you still could drink juice if it has to be. Just come prepared. It is no fun thing for sure but really not worth to get bothered by too much.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 7:</b> I removed all my 4 wisdom teeth and I didn\u2019t have to do any thing different on my routine. It\u2019s a pretty straight forward surgery. One of mine were infected and twisted so it took a while maybe 2 hours and recovery was painful and slow. Other 3 were around 30 mins and easy peasy recovery. I didn\u2019t find my T1D influenced in any part of the procedures.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 8:</b> Just make sure your sugars are good before the procedure starts.  You can double check to make sure they know you are an insulin dependent diabetic, but they should already know that.  Will be a quick out patient procedure.  Each wisdom tooth probably anywhere from 1-10 minutes depending on how deeply impacted it is.   You don't have to be sedated unless you want to be.  Can easily be done with just local anesthesia as well.\n\nI am a dentist.<br><br>\n", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 2054, "end": 2216, "span": "I would eat normally but at least 2 hours before the procedure and then maybe a small snack before to have stable blood sugars, maybe slightly higher than normal.", "annotation": "verifiable claim"}], "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 50s "}}

Do you have a CGM?<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> They are probably going to ask you to reduce your basal insulin a bit before the surgery because doctors prefer you run a bit on the high side while they're working on you.   The good thing about wisdom teeth is that they heal-up pretty quickly so you will be able to drink and eat soft foods almost immediately afterwards.  \n\n\nI also have two follow-up questions:  Does your dentist know you're a Type 1?  Does your doctor / endo know you're getting your wisdom teeth done?  If the answer to either of these questions is \"no\", then you need to contact them and let them know because they will most likely have lots of good information to share with you and each other.  Good luck!<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> I'm confused by the question! The answer is: just like any human being having a surgery. You're only different because your pancreas does not produce enough/any insulin. That has nothing to do with surgery anywhere. I had all 4 horizontal wisdom teeth cut out many years ago in 2 surgeries, but each was day surgery and then back to work/home.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> Call your endo<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> I have been concious every time. With a wackload of freezing. Wisdom teeth (2 impacted), pulled infected molar/implant install, root canal and crowns. The infected tooth was the worth. Everything else was not too bad, just the sound of them breaking up the bones for the impacted teeth or having it pulled it really weird.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 6:</b> I made this several times on MDI. I don't think you need to reduce your basal tbd. The operation only takes a short time, a few minutes and you will probably get locally numbing. \n\nI would eat normally but at least 2 hours before the procedure and then maybe a small snack before to have stable blood sugars, maybe slightly higher than normal. \n\nIf you get low during the procedure you still could drink juice if it has to be. Just come prepared. It is no fun thing for sure but really not worth to get bothered by too much.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 7:</b> I removed all my 4 wisdom teeth and I didn\u2019t have to do any thing different on my routine. It\u2019s a pretty straight forward surgery. One of mine were infected and twisted so it took a while maybe 2 hours and recovery was painful and slow. Other 3 were around 30 mins and easy peasy recovery. I didn\u2019t find my T1D influenced in any part of the procedures.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 8:</b> Just make sure your sugars are good before the procedure starts.  You can double check to make sure they know you are an insulin dependent diabetic, but they should already know that.  Will be a quick out patient procedure.  Each wisdom tooth probably anywhere from 1-10 minutes depending on how deeply impacted it is.   You don't have to be sedated unless you want to be.  Can easily be done with just local anesthesia as well.\n\nI am a dentist.<br><br>\n", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 1905, "end": 1953, "span": "I don't think you need to reduce your basal tbd.", "annotation": "verifiable claim"}], "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 54s "}}

Mine (tslim) has an exercise mode which I turn on 1.5 to 2 hours before climbing or running and it slowly reduces the amount of basal insulin on board. Then I get waaay less lows which exercising.

I\u2019ve been having a hard time with going low during exercise. I\u2019ve already heard all the basic stuff like starting with a higher sugar and eating a snack in the middle of your exercise. I\u2019ll start playing tennis at 180, eat some skittles in like an hour, maybe drink a juice another hour after that, and still end up low to often. I usually play tennis for 3-4 hours so I always bring candy just in case but I\u2019m really getting tired of eating so much god dam junk. My levels are so unstable when I play. A few days ago I started at 330, and within the hour was at 52, no correction dose either. How can I keep stable sugars while playing? Could eating some longer chain carbohydrates that take longer to break down help?</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> Try to exercise with very little to no insulin on board. For me this was either exercising early in the morning when I just woke up or waking up pretty early (7am) having breakfast and bolusing as normal but then only exercising at 11am.\n\nTry figure out when your insulin peaks, my insulin always brings down my blood sugar drastically at 1hr 30 mins - 2 hr after bolusing. Because of this I try exercise 2hr 30 mins - 3hr after my last bolus. \n\nGoodluck man, it\u2019s great you\u2019re exercising \ud83d\ude00<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> I\u2019ve found that sometimes I can prevent a low during exercise if I add some protein before I workout, like a hard boiled egg. As you suggested a more complex carb might also help stabilize your bg, like bread. Can\u2019t guarantee sadly, but might be worth a try. Sorry it has been such a nuisance, it\u2019s awesome you keep at it despite the lows.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> Aerobic exercise (cardio, which tennis is) will burn sugar. Anaerobic workout requiring muscular bursts (weight training, HIIT, etc) will create stress, this a release of muscle energy from the body, glucagon, to fuel those muscles. That generally makes our b.s. rise.\n\nVery little/ no insulin on board should help. DEF eat complex carbs and some fat before workout. I knock back sugar in the raw packets as needed - measurable , quick dissolve, and free at any coffee house. My life is littered with them in cars, purses, etc.\nBIGGEST TIP: Follow Lauren Bongiorno with Risely - she is on IG and has a very informative podcast. She's a beast for workouts so she really knows a lot, and almost NEVER drops in extended aerobic workout \ud83d\udcaa<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> Before heading out for a longer run (above 15miles) I would make sure there was little to no insulin on board then eat a peanut butter & banana sandwich before heading out. Yes my sugars would rise but they never went above 180; I\u2019d also make sure I had some energy gels with carbs in them in me plus the obligatory sweets (my go to were jelly babies but I\u2019m the UK so no sure what the US equivalent is sorry). Also be ready for the later hypo that can happen a few hours after exercise but usually a nice carby meal takes care of that (mine was always a bowl of porridge). \n\nA little tip I learned from my diabetes nurse & bizarrely it does work; if I was heading downwards do a quick burst of very intense running and it does bring your sugars up! No idea of the science behind it but it works!<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> Right: you have a good basis, but it\u2019s not actually the best thing to do here, (it\u2019s not your fault, and I\u2019m not blaming you, you just need to readjust)\n\n1. Do you take basal morning or evening, or both? If it\u2019s both or morning, consider taking a unit less on days you plan to exercise.\n\n2. Timing is important. When you tennis, how long has it been since you took your bolus (short acting)? If you eat breakfast and immediately go to play, you will need way less insulin at that meal than if you eat breakfast at 8 but don\u2019t go out to play until 11. Short acting peaks at about 2 ish hours and lasts 4-5, so it might be beneficial to try to nudge your exercise routine to the end of it\u2019s effectiveness, not the beginning. \n\nIf that\u2019s not an option (which sometimes it\u2019s not), you need to be taking less insulin at the meal before sports. Have they covered carb counting and insulin to carb ratios yet? Because that\u2019s quite important. (I have more information on this if you wish to have it)\n\n3. I would also recommend the snacks be less high on the GI scale, and also changing when you take them. \n\nYou have skittles and juice, both of which are basically just pure sugar. I think it would be better if you could add something that raises you slower as well. \n\nFor me, when I\u2019m swimming, I have fruit (usually mango or grapes) about 20 minutes before I start swimming. About 12 grams carbs. Right before I go in, I have two glucose tablets (8grams carbs). I generally end up starting at 8-9 mmol (144-162) and then finishing at 7-8 mmol (108-144). Which is pretty solid. Fruit and milk and fruity yogurts are all healthier options than skittles. Maybe you could try adding them instead?\n\nKeep juice on hand, and have some right before you start, because the fruit/yogurts won\u2019t kick in until about 45 mins after you eat it, because the fibre/fats slow down the absorption of the carbs. You\u2019ll still need some fast acting most likely, but at least you won\u2019t be downing a lot (100ml apple juice is about 11 grams carbs, which is probably the amount I\u2019d start with)<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 6:</b> Check out diabetes training camp teen camp. You\u2019ll get a ton out of it and Dr Matt will set you up for long term success.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 7:</b> I exercise in the AM when I am more insulin resistant. I have something with protein and fat to keep me stable with no short acting for it. Sometimes this is coffee and cream or a peanut butter sandwhich (depending on how low I am). If it is really intense, then I might add a juice.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 8:</b> I assume that you aren\u2019t pumping.  On advantage of a pump is turning down basal while exercising.. or just removing it.  This is like not having any long acting bringing you down during exercise.  \nThe other approach possible if using something like lantus is a split dose night and morning\u2026run a reduced long acting during active days.   The disadvantage is you will run higher before and after workouts. And if you cancel workouts you\u2019ll run real high.\n\nGood luck<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 9:</b> The key is to have a lower basal rate during physical activity. If you're MDI, plan a day in advance and lower the basal. If you're on pump, it's much easier to manage. I have 6 basal rates that I select to match what I'm doing next and I select it BEFORE I begin. For tennis and long bike rides, I have peanut butter and jelly sandwiches plus dates with walnuts. I never eat empty calories.\n\nYou might enjoy reading about Bill Talbert, the first diabetic tennis (and Davis Cup) player. He developed his net game so he could limit lows by reducing running back and forth across the baseline... His life inspired me to take up tennis after diagnosis at age 13 in 1965. I still play tennis, ride a bike etc., and use a sensor, pump, with iPhone/Apple Watch. For me, this is the closest thing to a cure until there is one and avoid unexpected lows. My last 7 year average A1c is 5.6 (range 5.4-5.9) without hypoglycemia.\n\nWith Joy and Radiance, Live Long and Prosper<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 10:</b> Sugar is bad at preventing lows, you need calories, not just sugar.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 11:</b> Everyone's T1D is unique, and it really takes time and effort to understand yours and get comfortable managing it.\n\nI *really* struggled with this when I first got diagnosed, in college.\n\nWhat insulin(s) and delivery system do you use? I'm on MDI.\n\nEating protiens,fats, and while wheats can help keep BG up for a period of evercise. Even very sugar rich things like sports drinks or candy bars may raise your sugar very high, but crash back down - the quick sugar rush.\n\nI split my basal in to two doses to avoid lows. After years I kind of found my equilibrium - I take a certain dose of basal, but I *need* to get a certain amount of exercise to keep sugars stable, otherwise they go up. Corrective doses, or even just a 20 minute walk around the block (properly timed) can keep them in check. \n\nI can take one full rest day before they will start to climb. If I know I'm going to be taking a few days off, I increase my basal 10%.\n\nI encourage you to be brave, and experiment (safely) with your body and your habits and find out what works for your diabetes. Keep snacks around.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 12:</b> Granola bars. Those do wonders. Get a higher carb box and a medium carb box.

I know celiac is super common w t1d</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> It\u2019s essentially the same thing as T1, only different antibodies and a different target. Instead of attacking beta cells, it attacks the structures in your intestines that break down gluten. If you have the right antibodies, a test can verify celiac.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> I have a celiac's disease diagnosis from just the blood test.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> The celiac test gives false positives sometimes, but no false negatives. So if you pop negative you're good, but if you pop positive and they're not sure, they're gonna get up in ur duodenum for a lil biopsy. Personally I don't think having a related autoimmune disease is gonna hit the accuracy of the test, but I'm not a doctor, and this is probably a better question for one of them.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> Some gastroenterologists will give you a diagnosis based on blood test results alone if you meet a certain threshold. Overall, the endoscopy is the gold standard. My son\u2019s GE offered a diagnosis without the scope because his numbers were through the roof but we opted for the scope in case it ever precluded him from qualifying for other things later in life (treatment, insurance, tax exemptions etc). \n\nFWIW my son tolerated it really well at 5 years old. He was up and running around a few hours later.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> I would go to a gastroenterologist that will give you an endoscopy to make sure. I had two false readings when I was a kid, got an endoscopy and turned out to be acid reflux.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 6:</b> I had a blood genotype panel done and tested positive for the gene responsible for celiac disease, along with the normal Antibody tests. Endoscopy as well to verify villus atrophy and I had no villi left.<br><br>\n", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 435, "end": 523, "span": "It\u2019s essentially the same thing as T1, only different antibodies and a different target.", "annotation": "verifiable claim"}, {"start": 626, "end": 685, "span": "If you have the right antibodies, a test can verify celiac.", "annotation": "verifiable claim"}, {"start": 802, "end": 874, "span": "The celiac test gives false positives sometimes, but no false negatives.", "annotation": "verifiable claim"}], "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 48s "}}

She\u2019s always been a very slim person and had a very prominent jaw line until she got sick and eventually diagnosed. Her face hasn\u2019t looked the same in years. Of course, I would never say anything. But she has mentioned the change in her face to me many times before. She\u2019s mentioned it to doctors. They have suggested it could be mismanagement or maybe even a skin issue as she has a rare type of eczema. Lately she\u2019s been managing just fine and even started using a face cream to treat rosacea. But it\u2019s made no difference. Is mismanagement really the cause? </p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> I do find that if my diabetes is all out of whack i end up with water retention and in turn a puffy face, it may not be the only thing causing it but it wont be helping<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> Make sure her urine is being tested for protein at least once a year. Diabetes and high blood pressure are the leading causes of kidney disease and a puffy face can be a sign of kidney disease. \n\nIf she can access her test results, she should be looking for a urine ACR or a urine PCR to check for protein and then EGFR or creatinine level in the blood.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> It can.
