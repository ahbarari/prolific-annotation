{"id": "ch7kb8", "displayed_text": "<div class='post' style='user-select:none;'>\n  <h2>Post</h2>\n  <p>Can't seem to get my Blood Sugars down the last few days.\nMy A1C is typically around 7.0 so I feel I have good control of my sugars. However, this last week has been a struggle for some reason. It seems like not matter what I do I can't get it to stay below 200. I exercise, eat pretty well(no fast food and watch the carbs), don't really drink, and don't smoke but having a hard time getting it down. \n\nExample: Sugar is 138 about to eat so I take Humalog. Made a sandwich, portioned out some chips, and had unsweet tea. 3 hours later my sugar is 240 and my CGM says it's trending upwards. Take 10units only to find it does nothing.  Dinner time comes and I'm still around 230. I take my normal 20units but don't eat and watch my monitor. 2 hrs later sugar is only 220. Go to bed after taking my Lantus, wake up and my sugar is 240. Ugggggghhhh. Take 20 units and 2 hrs later it's still 220. Take 10 more units and 2 hrs later it's up 240 and I haven't eaten and just had water to drink.\n\nBeen like this all week. Any ideas?</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> Hard to know for sure. Some common causes are: 1. hormones from, say, stress, menstruation, or pregnancy 2. infection 3. intermittent beta cell activity in honeymoon<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> Are you on a pump? Try a new site. Or try to correct with an injection, first, to see if that\u2019s it. \n\nIs your insulin off? Try a new bottle. \n\nAre your basal rates on point?<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> Basal is spot on and I tried a new bottle of insulin. I don't use the pump, I use Humalog and a syringe. Going to try a new spot. Always forget about that.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> Could be an infection or a number of other reasons.  I saw that you mentioned that you will try a new injection site - Rotating sites is important .  But, just to be on safe side , call your physician or diabetes go-to -professional to be sure something else is not going on.  Good luck.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> Well, it seems like switching injection sites did the trick. Moved from my arms to injecting in my thighs and for the last 24hrs my sugar has averaged 160. \n\nThanks for the advice. It's funny how something so small can make such a difference. Stupid ass diabetes.<br><br>\n", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 1150, "end": 1154, "span": "Hard", "annotation": "verifiable claim"}], "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 5s "}}
