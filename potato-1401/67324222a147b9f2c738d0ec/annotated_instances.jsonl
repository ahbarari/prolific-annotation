Any tips to avoid?</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> If you guys have a designated person usually they love doing all this medical stuff atleast my friends do hahaha. I usually tell them to give me 2 shots if my sugar is over 12 cause trying to stay tight never works.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> Check your blood sugar as often as possible. \n\nHave something to correct a low. Have at least one friend around who knows how to recognize and treat a low or severe high.\n\nBe willing to run a little high if necessary. A drunk night at 180-200 is better than risking a devastating low.\n\nBut really staying aware of your readings is most important. Even if you barely remember the next day, a low or high reading is probably going to trigger your drunk mind to either eat or bolus/inject as necessary.\n\nETA: Also consider what you\u2019re drinking. Alcohol is different for everyone. For me beer raises my blood sugar, hard liquor has no impact (unless mixed with a sugary drink), and wine seems to lower my blood sugar.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> i personally avoid carby alcohol like beer and wine. if i go for cocktails, i dont give any insulin as the alcohol content will lower me while the sugar in the mixers will keep me higher.\nif mixing a spirit and diet mixer i make sure to keep snacking through the night (like small crisps or something)\n\nmake sure there's someone with you who knows how to look out for a hypo in you and keep checking sugars often.\n \ni went out the other day for cocktails but still had to suspend my basal a few hours later as the alcohol made me drop quite quick so watch out for that as well<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> My nurse told me that after a night out, I should eat junk food and not shoot insulin for it. Works for me, but I only got really drunk a few times after diagnosis. Covid etc.\n\nLiver burns sugar when getting rid of alcohol. And it's too busy with the alcohol to release sugar to compensate for a low.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> I know this will get downvoted because it\u2019s not what you want to hear, but you could try moderation. Just one or two drinks. \n\nYou could offer to be the designated driver! \n\nThat is the only sure way to drink safely as a person living with t1d. I learned that the hard way when I was in my 20\u2019s. It\u2019s been 20 years since I was drunk or high. I don\u2019t miss it. At all. \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I still enjoy beer, wine, and the occasional high ball, but inebriation is just not an option. Gotta stay in control, you know? \n\nBe safe!<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 6:</b> Eat before. Test lots. Make sure you have a snack before bed (this one is the most important). From my own experience, I bolus for the first two beers max, but then don\u2019t for any more. I usually stick with Gin and Soda as that keeps me stable, but after 5 I will start to trend down. Even if my sugars are on the higher side (8-9), I would have a peanut butter sandwich with no bolus before sleeping so that I don\u2019t go low. \n\nWatch out for lows the next day! I usually only need minimal basal if any. Which is nice, especially if you want hungover chinese food.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 7:</b> Eat<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 8:</b> Eat a solid meal beforehand. For me protien helps keep sugars up but not super high. 6 hours later is kind of a gamble.\n\nCheck your sugar as often as you can; the more you know the better. But in the end it's better to be high than low.\n\nHaving someone around who knows your T1D in case things go really wrong can be a good buffer. Like if you're getting really sloppy, they can check your BG and at least know you're drunk and not super low.\n\nParty On!<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 9:</b> Never drink on an empty stomach<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 10:</b> 1. Eat before (something substantial)\n\n2. Check sugars every 45-60mins if you remember. Don\u2019t be to far away from quick acting carbs\n\n3. Have someone in the group know you have diabetes \n\n4. Have something to eat when you get home (best to make it before you go)\n\n5. Run sugars high overall for the night<br><br>\n", "label_annotations": {"no_claim": {"No claim detected.": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 19s "}}

I\u2019m just wondering if anyone can give me an answer as to why sometimes, I take a correctional dose before bed and it takes SOOO long to absorb into my system? Im pregnant (36w now) if that\u2019ll help anyone figure this out for me! Is it something to do with combatting hormones in my body? The insulin still ends up working, but it takes 6 hours to absorb completely! I was under the impression novorapid\u2019s effects stop around the 3-4 hour mark. It\u2019s mainly an annoyance more than a concern, thanks for any answers lol. Type 1 pregnancy is a wild ride so I understand if nobody can answer this burning question xD</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> I\u2019ve (male, not pregnant) noticed this at times with novorapid too. Haven\u2019t really figured out why, but sometimes I wonder if you take a small amount, if it takes longer to move from the small depot formed under the skin and into the blood stream. How much are you taking for this correction?<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> Going to bed can make us more resistant to insulin. Lying still, with a lower heart rate is a recipe for slow absorption.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> I have the same issue, for me I find splitting my injection in 2. So if I'm doing 4units I'll do 2u in one spot and 2u in a different spot. Seems to make it \"activate\" a bit quicker. \nNot giving advice, just saying what works for me.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> I\u2019m about a week behind you (35w) and the same thing happens to me! I\u2019ve attributed it to lack of blood flow when I lay down from all the extra weight/baby taking up so much room. Also you have so many hormones in your system right now (as I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve already noticed \ud83d\ude02) that insulin just sometimes won\u2019t work.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> Does it eventually work? Or are you requiring more and more to get the same correction?\n\nIf it\u2019s a normal dose but just taking longer, not sure what to think of that. If you\u2019re just requiring more, during pregnancy the placenta produces human placental lactogen \u2014 a fancy way of saying a hormone that makes you more insulin resistant. Especially during the third trimester \u2014 your insulin requirements can be up to 2x normal. It\u2019s cool in theory \u2014 it allows the fetus to get more glucose by preventing mom from stealing all of it, but obviously not good for T1D mommas.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 6:</b> This is gonna sound so stupidly simple, but taking a short walk after bolusing helps absorption - tremendously!

{"id": "1bpwmkp", "displayed_text": "<div class='post' style='user-select:none;'>\n  <h2>Post</h2>\n  <p>How to prep for physical activity/vaca\nMy kiddo is a teenager with newly diagnosed T1D. We're going on a previously planned vaca that will include sight seeing, walking around in towns and cities, and a couple days at a remote cabin with all day hiking/climbing/swimming in a national park. The cabin has facilities & a refrigerator. My child still wants to go and the Endo team told us we should absolutely still take the trip. \n\nI know we need to bring a lot of diabetes supplies for the trip (was planning on 150% to 200% of what i think we'll need, including both the gvokes we have), and I know we get an extra bag for med supplies which can include food. Also know kiddo needs to have high glucose when we set out in the a.m. for a physically active day (hiking), and we need to have lots of fruit, Gatorade, candy/quick sugar on hand all day. We are a sml group and can set our pace to meet my T1D's needs. Kiddo won't have a pump yet, but does have a cgm. I'm thinking I'll set the cgm so it alarms a low warning at 75 or 80 so we can catch it early.\n\nWhat else can you think of? Any suggestions?</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> When I was young (dx age 13, 72 now) the endocrinologist said I shouldn't be afraid to make small changes in my insulin dose ahead of physical activity. Back then the insulins were different but the idea is the same.  Consider reducing the long acting dose (basal) and even eliminating or reducing bolus dose for all day outings. Be aware if the outdoor activities are such that they are a \"stress\" you may see blood glucose rise due to epinephrine > hepatic glucagon >>> glucose. Given the lag between sensor interstitial fluid glucose reading and actual blood glucose (up to 25 min.), set the alarm to no less than 80 mg/dL and, more importantly, make decisions based on the trend so you can intercept lows before they occur. Once you have a pump, this will be easier to navigate but still requires mindful choices (not mindless).\n\nMy sensor transmits to iPhone and I can see the reading and trend on Apple Watch. This makes an all day hike or bike ride a cake walk without hypoglycemia drama. Regarding food on an all day adventure, I always carry several peanut butter and jelly sandwiches so I don't have to \"feed that dumb \\[injected\\] insulin\" with candy, glucose, juice...\n\nWith Joy and Radiance, Live Long and Prosper<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> Low warning earlier definitely is a good idea. For hiking I might consider even a higher alarm. For me personally this type of activities needs just extra carbs in between, so I might already eat my banana when I see I am trending in the lower hundreds. \n\nI would also reduce the basal around 10-20 percent and the bolus dose I would probably reduce even more drastic. Also after a day of activity and in the night less insulin would be needed. There is only trial and error to collect the needed experience but in general I would be quite conservative in my experiments. A higher level can be corrected easily with all the hiking and activity happening.\n\nDoubling the equipment is a good idea, I would also do it like this.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> I am also new to this\u2026 do longer acting carbs ( beans/pasta) first thing in am help with lows after activity or no carbs so no bolus given, therefore activity is being done just on basal?<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> I used to work at a diabetes camp that did teen sessions with both hiking and multi day backpacking sessions in the high country, kids did fine! You don\u2019t need to start the day high, just maybe slightly elevated, like 150. \n\nThings to consider: \n-you\u2019ll most likely need to significantly decrease basal insulin by at least 1/3. Maybe even 1/2 if you\u2019re hiking all day. Check with a CDE or your endo\u2019s office. \n\n-take breaks while swimming, try to check blood sugar every hour. Make sure they have candy in a waist pouch/dry bag or something similar if your kid is swimming out into a lake or will be far from shore. \n\n-definitely print out some logbook pages/log in some way and try to write down all food and dosages so you can see how dosages are working, and be prepared to adjust as needed.\n\n-exercise can cause lows at night, so make sure your teen has low supplies by their bed, and make sure you\u2019ll wake up if low alarms happen. \n\n-plan on having snacks without taking insulin, prepare with lots of low blood sugar supplies.\n\n-bring a cooler if you\u2019re at the beach on the lake, to store insulin pens. Frio pouches are good for hikes if you\u2019ll be somewhere hot. \n\n-will you be at altitude you\u2019re not used to? Your child\u2019s body will be working harder just to acclimate, so you may need to adjust basal based on that alone. If kid gets altitude sick, give them regular sugar Gatorade or sugar cubes to suck on. \n\nWould also highly recommend a week at a diabetes camp this summer, depending on your kid\u2019s age! It can really help both technically (dialing in dosages) as well as socioemotionally.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> I find granola bars are good for when you\u2019re super low - gets me up faster than any candy etc. \n\nYou\u2019ll be fine. Sounds like you\u2019re well prepared. It\u2019ll get easier, trust me. I\u2019ve traveled the world with type 1. A few crazy episodes but most of it was avoidable. Just have fun. And always bring more for lows than you think you\u2019ll need. Have everyone with you being something (granola, gummies, glucose tablets etc). Nothing scarier than being in the middle of nowhere and realizing your blood is low and you got nothing. Extra, always. \n\nGood luck.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 6:</b> Test more, carry snacks, you got it. You got the right idea setting the envelope higher on your cgm too. You'll probably want to spike the bs harder starting out, but you can shrink that pad as time passes and everyone gets more experience of what to expect in terms of how much drop associated with what kind of activity.  (Remember protein with snacks slows stuff down.)\n\nNot too much else going on. Remind the kid they can set their own pace. Remind them to have fun too. \nI hated the adjustment of having to do medical shit when I worked out, but i got used to it. \nThey can do most things that they want to, they just might have to make small adaptations.<br><br>\n", "label_annotations": {"no_claim": {"No claim detected.": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 10s "}}

What were the symptoms and what were the sugar levels, etc.? I\u2019m worried about my 4 year old</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> Talk to your kids pediatrician. If they are having any symptoms, it may not be diabetes but may be just as serious.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> The symptoms of high blood sugar can be numerous but just vauge enough that they can be confused with other maladies or sometimes just normal ups and downs of kids.\n\nBut in general, they present themselves in the following ways:\n\n1. Thirst, often extreme. Kids being kids, their first intinct will often be to reach for a sugary drink to relieve the thirst, which makes it worse\n\n2. Frequent urination (sometimes, but not always, the urine will have a mildly sweet aroma)\n\n3. Fatigue, often extreme\n\n4. Headaches\n\n5. Feeling warm/sweaty without enviornmental trigger\n\n6. Ravenous hunger, often times not helped with food.\n\n7. Unexpected weight loss or inability to gain weight\n\nThese will often worsen or become more obvious as sugars move higher. In the most severe cases, diabetes needing immediate medical intervention will present with vomiting, shallow breathing, woozy ness, etc.\n\nIf your child has several of these symptoms regularly, then it would be wise to check with your doctor. It doesn't necessaril mean diabetes, but it could be or any other number of treatable conditions.\n\nFailing that, most drug stores now sell over the counter gluconeters and test strips that are not absurdly expensive and do not require a prescription. You can use one of those to check your kiddo's blood sugar a few times (make sure to read up on proper testing procedure first).\n\nIf their fasting glucose (not having esten for 8 hours) is under 70 or over 120 or if their post meal glucose is over 170-180, then that is awarning sign something is up and it's time to see the doctor immediately.\n\nBut beyond that my advice would be... don't panic, regardless of what you discover via symptoms and/or testing. They may be diabetic. They may very well not. But even if they are, while it isn't fun and presents many challenges, it is treatable and manageable. And as a parent you are doing the right thing and asking the right questions by checking now.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> I was 3. Very thirsty and peeing constantly for me<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> With BG at 89, I\u2019m not sure why you are worried about type 1 diabetes. Increased thirst and urination in t1d comes from BG being very high and your body trying to flush sugar and ketones.  If concerned (like you are)  I would always check with your doctor. I am not in the medical field or even qualified to give any advice, but I personally don\u2019t see anything to be concerned with.  89 is an extremely healthy normal level for a child.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> Does he crave juices sugary snack and high carb foods?
