I\u2019m just wondering if anyone can give me an answer as to why sometimes, I take a correctional dose before bed and it takes SOOO long to absorb into my system? Im pregnant (36w now) if that\u2019ll help anyone figure this out for me! Is it something to do with combatting hormones in my body? The insulin still ends up working, but it takes 6 hours to absorb completely! I was under the impression novorapid\u2019s effects stop around the 3-4 hour mark. It\u2019s mainly an annoyance more than a concern, thanks for any answers lol. Type 1 pregnancy is a wild ride so I understand if nobody can answer this burning question xD</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> I\u2019ve (male, not pregnant) noticed this at times with novorapid too. Haven\u2019t really figured out why, but sometimes I wonder if you take a small amount, if it takes longer to move from the small depot formed under the skin and into the blood stream. How much are you taking for this correction?<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> Going to bed can make us more resistant to insulin. Lying still, with a lower heart rate is a recipe for slow absorption.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> I have the same issue, for me I find splitting my injection in 2. So if I'm doing 4units I'll do 2u in one spot and 2u in a different spot. Seems to make it \"activate\" a bit quicker. \nNot giving advice, just saying what works for me.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> I\u2019m about a week behind you (35w) and the same thing happens to me! I\u2019ve attributed it to lack of blood flow when I lay down from all the extra weight/baby taking up so much room. Also you have so many hormones in your system right now (as I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve already noticed \ud83d\ude02) that insulin just sometimes won\u2019t work.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> Does it eventually work? Or are you requiring more and more to get the same correction?\n\nIf it\u2019s a normal dose but just taking longer, not sure what to think of that. If you\u2019re just requiring more, during pregnancy the placenta produces human placental lactogen \u2014 a fancy way of saying a hormone that makes you more insulin resistant. Especially during the third trimester \u2014 your insulin requirements can be up to 2x normal. It\u2019s cool in theory \u2014 it allows the fetus to get more glucose by preventing mom from stealing all of it, but obviously not good for T1D mommas.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 6:</b> This is gonna sound so stupidly simple, but taking a short walk after bolusing helps absorption - tremendously!
