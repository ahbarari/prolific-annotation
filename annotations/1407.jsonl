I got instructions on how to increase until it stabilized.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> For me, my very long honeymoon was over when I had to dose for fat and protein, for hormonal shifts, for illness, etc. I had been on lower doses of basal and bolus prior to that. I required insulin for fast  rises from carbs, but my body still handled some of the slower impacts for me. My total daily dose basically doubled.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 6:</b> Was not a sudden change, happened slowly over about 9 months, as meals started causing more highs requires more insulin, basal needed to be increased etc.\n\nWe went from about 24 units a day to 50-60, basal doubled as well. Carb ratio went from 15/1 to about 10 now, 8 in the morning<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 7:</b> If you want glucose levels to look for, my endo told me the numbers to look out for was staying above 180 mg/dL 2 hours after a meal consistently, or waking up above 140 mg/dL consistently<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 8:</b> Watching my T1 friend, I think you know looking back. I don't think it's easy to know while it's happening. \n\nMy friend knew it was done when her basals, insulin to carb ratios, and correction boluses evened out. She shifted from the short term rollercoaster of the honeymoon phase where mixing your insulin with shots/boluses makes you go low or high--to the long term roller coaster of T1 where you work to tweak your insulin amounts based on stress, activity, hormone cycles, time of day etc.\n\nUnless others know of a way, I think you'll know when things enter a new stable phase for like 3 to 6 months.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 9:</b> maybe you just got diagnosed after your honeymoon period was over? that\u2019s kinda what happened to me, i got sick as a kid and that\u2019s when they think i developed t1d but i wasn\u2019t diagnosed till a couple years later, i was sick most of the time in between being super sick as a kid and diagnosis but i think it\u2019s safe to say i wasn\u2019t diagnosed in my honeymoon phase so i never had to experience it or any of the changes it could have made to my diabetes management. maybe something similar happened?<br><br>\n", "label_annotations": {"no_claim": {"No claim detected.": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 8s "}}

It is a VERY common occurrence that I go to bed in range (90-150ish) and then I wake up in the 300s. I know that my dinner and slow releasing carbs can be playing a role, but all the way up to 350? Really? \n\nMy question is this: Can I take a small amount of long acting insulin to fight this? Has anyone had this problem while on MDI? \n\nI\u2019m taking a break from the pump and I am not currently wearing a CGM. Help.\n\nUPDATE: I split my long acting dose yesterday. 15U in the morning and 15U in the evening. Ate Chipotle last night at 9pm, woke up at 142! Wooo!!!</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> It\u2019s possible your sugar is also dipping much too low during the night and your body is trying to counteract that, but it then has no way to lower it again before morning comes. Have any of your endos ever recommended setting an alarm to do a middle of the night check (for at least several nights) to see what the problem is?<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> we were having trouble with middle of the night spikes with my toddler, so grain of salt with this comparison. We did splitting long acting with just a unit at night, but from in range and even slightly above range (like 200-225) he\u2019s end up crashing low before morning. We ended up upping his morning long acting a bit so he had more on board, and then stacking his evening doses- regular pre bolus before dinner, plus and extra half unit or so not super long before bed (about an hour later). If you\u2019re going to bed not long after eating, might be something to consider, but set your alarm a couple of times through the night for a couple of days of doing that to see what\u2019s going on for sure.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> If you are sure you have slow releasing carbs that are still coming, you could bolus for them.  You have to be careful, but I\u2019ve never had anything slower than 5 or 6 hours, which is similar to the length of a FIASP shot for me.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> What does your Endo say?? Also, yes, when not on a pump you\u2019ll need long and shot acting insulin.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> If you are MDI, you should be taking some sort of long acting insulin. When my 9 year daughter was diagnosed last year and did MDI, her Lantus ranged from 4-8 units. It was a constant adjustment. We are now on the pump, but she currently has to take 16 units of basal each day rather then Lantus. \nCall your endo. You probably need Lantus adjustment or Lantus in general. Also, it may be good to wake up at 3:00 am and do a correction (do you have dexcom? It\u2019s excellent!)<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 6:</b> For clarification, I am already taking my long acting insulin every morning at 8am. I was using the Medtronic 670g and the Guardian 3 sensor, but I just needed a break. Too many things connected to me and I was burnt out. \n\nIs it possible that the long acting just starts to wear off at 2 or 3 in the morning? I knows it\u2019s designed to slowly release for 24 hours, but who knows. \n\nYes, I know it\u2019s a good idea to wake up in the middle of the night and check/correct ... I\u2019m just being selfish with my sleep.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 7:</b> I take 44u levemir per day. I was always high in the morning as well. I started split dosing 22u AM and 22u PM. 12 hours apart per my endo. Morning highs resolved. Have a chat with your endo to see what may work for you \ud83d\ude0a<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 8:</b> This was happening to me as well, my diabetes nurse told me to split my long acting insulin into two doses (Long acting says it lasts 24hrs in your system but it usually only last around 20hrs)\n\nI was taking 10 units of lantus once a day, but now I take 5 units in the morning and 5 units in the night and I haven't been getting any major spikes since.

Currently we have humalog and lispro which we use for MDI which I know the pump can work with. We had been trying to move to lyumjev for MDI and just got a prescription for it. This has a 5 min time to onset instead of the 15 minute with humalog.\n\nBut now we were able to get an appointment for pump setup. So, can we use faster acting insulin like lyumjev with the op5 as well when we get started on the pump? Or does that only work with humalog/lispro/etc with 15 minute time to onset?</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> The system isn\u2019t designed for it, but it will probably be fine. Yes, the initial appearance is faster, but the peak blood concentration is still almost an hour out.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> I mean this is a 5 second google search, they did not approve or test or modify the algorithm in OP5 to be used with anything except for Humalog & Novolog.\n\nIdk why you would get a closed loop system and immediately subvert the algorithm by screwing with its data using an insulin it isn't accurately calculating action time for. Like what is the upside? Especially with a 6 year old, that would mean way higher likelihood of lows using an insulin faster than what the algorithm is expecting. Horrible idea.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> Yup, I'm using lumjev in my op5<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> Insulet hasn\u2019t officially approved it to work with other insulins, but yes it can. The most important thing, in my opinion, would be whether your endo is comfortable with it. Mine was the one to suggest Fiasp, and he double checked with his Education team and they said it\u2019s fine. All have been using it with patients on OP5 since the system launched. I haven\u2019t had any ill effects or bumps in the algorithm since switching.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> I bet it would work, but you may see things like the system thinking you have slightly more IOB than you actually do.\n\nBut, all in all, I doubt it will be a huge problem. If anything, I think it would tend to control highs better at first, and then have lingering \"backside\" stubborness of bg.\n\nLike, when going high, it would likely react strongly at first, bringing you down, but then assume the insulin has more strength left in it than it really does, so it might reduce your basal and you could have some trailing highs in hour 4+.\n\nFor a 6yo, that's probably still a win.\n\n(Android APS or Loop have lyumjev programmed in, so those would work with it without that drawback)<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 6:</b> I'm in Humalog and Lyumjev with Omnipod 5. I don't change settings when using it. My body just doesn't react to Humalog after a few weeks, but will to Lyumjev. Then it doesn't react as well to Lyumjev and I switch back to Humalog. Basel rates and carb ratio stay the same.

I know it\u2019s not an ideal suggestion but it does seem like you\u2019d be much better off somewhere else that would give you what you need without charging you!<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> Go to Eli lily\u2019s website and get their savings card. Basically it\u2019s a card you get from their website. Very quick and easy. It lets you buy your insulin each month for 45 dollars, regardless of how much you use. So tell your doctor you\u2019re using more insulin and bam you can get a ton of insulin for 45 dollars a month. No insurance needed<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> Okay so, it\u2019s not the end of the world. That\u2019s not how it works. (Source: had marketplace insurance and switched mid year because I got a good full time job) You\u2019re going to be okay, please don\u2019t panic. \n\nIt\u2019s income adjusted. You get to keep your marketplace plan until your new workplace insurance kicks in. You get to keep your subsidy until your income changes. So here\u2019s how it works!\n\nNow: renew your marketplace plan or pick a new one. You get a subsidy. Keep refilling your stuff like a champ. \n\nMay: congratulations on graduation! \n\nMay/June/whatever: start your new job AND call the marketplace and adjust to your new income. It\u2019s a form, they were super nice to me when I did it. You will probably lose most, if not all of your subsidy. \n\nJuly/August: your new insurance kicks in. Call the marketplace by mid month to cancel your plan. \n\nIf you forget to adjust and it doesn\u2019t start until the next month, that\u2019s fine. You repay it in your taxes. There\u2019s a max for how much they can make you repay. You will have insurance and insulin. You\u2019ll also start a new deductible with your new insurance which sucks.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> hopefully you find a job that provides coverage immediately. some places have a waiting period, some don\u2019t. i just started a new job and my\ninsurance was effective my first day.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> Start hoarding. Tell your endo to write out a bigger need and pick up some extra bottles to last you through the 2 months it'll take to get coverage. Just explain the situation to your doc. He'll try everything in his power to help you survive<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 6:</b> Get your endo to increase your monthly prescription - allows you to build up a back stock. Like mine is written for 3 bottles/month when I probably use just about 2.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 7:</b> You should be negotiating any salary you're offered and that includes benefits. EVERYTHING is negotiable. You can likely get them to start coverage early if negotiate at the offer stage.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 8:</b> Most full time jobs offer benefits for the positions you would be looking for.

It is a VERY common occurrence that I go to bed in range (90-150ish) and then I wake up in the 300s. I know that my dinner and slow releasing carbs can be playing a role, but all the way up to 350? Really? \n\nMy question is this: Can I take a small amount of long acting insulin to fight this? Has anyone had this problem while on MDI? \n\nI\u2019m taking a break from the pump and I am not currently wearing a CGM. Help.\n\nUPDATE: I split my long acting dose yesterday. 15U in the morning and 15U in the evening. Ate Chipotle last night at 9pm, woke up at 142! Wooo!!!</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> It\u2019s possible your sugar is also dipping much too low during the night and your body is trying to counteract that, but it then has no way to lower it again before morning comes. Have any of your endos ever recommended setting an alarm to do a middle of the night check (for at least several nights) to see what the problem is?<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> we were having trouble with middle of the night spikes with my toddler, so grain of salt with this comparison. We did splitting long acting with just a unit at night, but from in range and even slightly above range (like 200-225) he\u2019s end up crashing low before morning. We ended up upping his morning long acting a bit so he had more on board, and then stacking his evening doses- regular pre bolus before dinner, plus and extra half unit or so not super long before bed (about an hour later). If you\u2019re going to bed not long after eating, might be something to consider, but set your alarm a couple of times through the night for a couple of days of doing that to see what\u2019s going on for sure.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> If you are sure you have slow releasing carbs that are still coming, you could bolus for them.  You have to be careful, but I\u2019ve never had anything slower than 5 or 6 hours, which is similar to the length of a FIASP shot for me.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> What does your Endo say?? Also, yes, when not on a pump you\u2019ll need long and shot acting insulin.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> If you are MDI, you should be taking some sort of long acting insulin. When my 9 year daughter was diagnosed last year and did MDI, her Lantus ranged from 4-8 units. It was a constant adjustment. We are now on the pump, but she currently has to take 16 units of basal each day rather then Lantus. \nCall your endo. You probably need Lantus adjustment or Lantus in general. Also, it may be good to wake up at 3:00 am and do a correction (do you have dexcom? It\u2019s excellent!)<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 6:</b> For clarification, I am already taking my long acting insulin every morning at 8am. I was using the Medtronic 670g and the Guardian 3 sensor, but I just needed a break. Too many things connected to me and I was burnt out. \n\nIs it possible that the long acting just starts to wear off at 2 or 3 in the morning? I knows it\u2019s designed to slowly release for 24 hours, but who knows. \n\nYes, I know it\u2019s a good idea to wake up in the middle of the night and check/correct ... I\u2019m just being selfish with my sleep.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 7:</b> I take 44u levemir per day. I was always high in the morning as well. I started split dosing 22u AM and 22u PM. 12 hours apart per my endo. Morning highs resolved. Have a chat with your endo to see what may work for you \ud83d\ude0a<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 8:</b> This was happening to me as well, my diabetes nurse told me to split my long acting insulin into two doses (Long acting says it lasts 24hrs in your system but it usually only last around 20hrs)\n\nI was taking 10 units of lantus once a day, but now I take 5 units in the morning and 5 units in the night and I haven't been getting any major spikes since.

I\u2019m going to graduate from university and hopefully get an engineering job approximately may or June and average pay for entry level positions here are 75k a year I\u2019ve done some rough math and with my expected income I\u2019ll make too much money and I don\u2019t qualify for any marketplace tax credit and all of the plans that I used to be able to afford are now $600-$700 a month premiums (I pay about $80 now). I can\u2019t afford that on my salary now,, I\u2019m living paycheck to paycheck as is. The cheapest plans dont cover anything and cost 4x as much.\nIn all of the interviews  I\u2019ve had so far I asked how soon I can get coverage after starting,, the average time is 2 months after start date. I suspected this might happen so I have been filing my scripts religiously as soon as I can but here we are in November and I only have enough to last me until April and I likely won\u2019t be able to afford coverage until august! How am I going to get insulin?</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> Would you ever consider making a move to a country with free health care like the U.K.? I know it\u2019s not an ideal suggestion but it does seem like you\u2019d be much better off somewhere else that would give you what you need without charging you!<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> Go to Eli lily\u2019s website and get their savings card. Basically it\u2019s a card you get from their website. Very quick and easy. It lets you buy your insulin each month for 45 dollars, regardless of how much you use. So tell your doctor you\u2019re using more insulin and bam you can get a ton of insulin for 45 dollars a month. No insurance needed<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> Okay so, it\u2019s not the end of the world. That\u2019s not how it works. (Source: had marketplace insurance and switched mid year because I got a good full time job) You\u2019re going to be okay, please don\u2019t panic. \n\nIt\u2019s income adjusted. You get to keep your marketplace plan until your new workplace insurance kicks in. You get to keep your subsidy until your income changes. So here\u2019s how it works!\n\nNow: renew your marketplace plan or pick a new one. You get a subsidy. Keep refilling your stuff like a champ. \n\nMay: congratulations on graduation! \n\nMay/June/whatever: start your new job AND call the marketplace and adjust to your new income. It\u2019s a form, they were super nice to me when I did it. You will probably lose most, if not all of your subsidy. \n\nJuly/August: your new insurance kicks in. Call the marketplace by mid month to cancel your plan. \n\nIf you forget to adjust and it doesn\u2019t start until the next month, that\u2019s fine. You repay it in your taxes. There\u2019s a max for how much they can make you repay. You will have insurance and insulin. You\u2019ll also start a new deductible with your new insurance which sucks.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> hopefully you find a job that provides coverage immediately. some places have a waiting period, some don\u2019t. i just started a new job and my\ninsurance was effective my first day.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> Start hoarding. Tell your endo to write out a bigger need and pick up some extra bottles to last you through the 2 months it'll take to get coverage. Just explain the situation to your doc. He'll try everything in his power to help you survive<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 6:</b> Get your endo to increase your monthly prescription - allows you to build up a back stock. Like mine is written for 3 bottles/month when I probably use just about 2.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 7:</b> You should be negotiating any salary you're offered and that includes benefits. EVERYTHING is negotiable. You can likely get them to start coverage early if negotiate at the offer stage.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 8:</b> Most full time jobs offer benefits for the positions you would be looking for.

It is a VERY common occurrence that I go to bed in range (90-150ish) and then I wake up in the 300s. I know that my dinner and slow releasing carbs can be playing a role, but all the way up to 350? Really? \n\nMy question is this: Can I take a small amount of long acting insulin to fight this? Has anyone had this problem while on MDI? \n\nI\u2019m taking a break from the pump and I am not currently wearing a CGM. Help.\n\nUPDATE: I split my long acting dose yesterday. 15U in the morning and 15U in the evening. Ate Chipotle last night at 9pm, woke up at 142! Wooo!!!</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> It\u2019s possible your sugar is also dipping much too low during the night and your body is trying to counteract that, but it then has no way to lower it again before morning comes. Have any of your endos ever recommended setting an alarm to do a middle of the night check (for at least several nights) to see what the problem is?<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> we were having trouble with middle of the night spikes with my toddler, so grain of salt with this comparison. We did splitting long acting with just a unit at night, but from in range and even slightly above range (like 200-225) he\u2019s end up crashing low before morning. We ended up upping his morning long acting a bit so he had more on board, and then stacking his evening doses- regular pre bolus before dinner, plus and extra half unit or so not super long before bed (about an hour later). If you\u2019re going to bed not long after eating, might be something to consider, but set your alarm a couple of times through the night for a couple of days of doing that to see what\u2019s going on for sure.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> If you are sure you have slow releasing carbs that are still coming, you could bolus for them.  You have to be careful, but I\u2019ve never had anything slower than 5 or 6 hours, which is similar to the length of a FIASP shot for me.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> What does your Endo say?? Also, yes, when not on a pump you\u2019ll need long and shot acting insulin.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> If you are MDI, you should be taking some sort of long acting insulin. When my 9 year daughter was diagnosed last year and did MDI, her Lantus ranged from 4-8 units. It was a constant adjustment. We are now on the pump, but she currently has to take 16 units of basal each day rather then Lantus. \nCall your endo. You probably need Lantus adjustment or Lantus in general. Also, it may be good to wake up at 3:00 am and do a correction (do you have dexcom? It\u2019s excellent!)<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 6:</b> For clarification, I am already taking my long acting insulin every morning at 8am. I was using the Medtronic 670g and the Guardian 3 sensor, but I just needed a break. Too many things connected to me and I was burnt out. \n\nIs it possible that the long acting just starts to wear off at 2 or 3 in the morning? I knows it\u2019s designed to slowly release for 24 hours, but who knows. \n\nYes, I know it\u2019s a good idea to wake up in the middle of the night and check/correct ... I\u2019m just being selfish with my sleep.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 7:</b> I take 44u levemir per day. I was always high in the morning as well. I started split dosing 22u AM and 22u PM. 12 hours apart per my endo. Morning highs resolved. Have a chat with your endo to see what may work for you \ud83d\ude0a<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 8:</b> This was happening to me as well, my diabetes nurse told me to split my long acting insulin into two doses (Long acting says it lasts 24hrs in your system but it usually only last around 20hrs)\n\nI was taking 10 units of lantus once a day, but now I take 5 units in the morning and 5 units in the night and I haven't been getting any major spikes since.

I have good control with an A1C or 5.5-6.0. I want to have kids and I\u2019m wondering if I have retinopathy, would I still be able to carry out a pregnancy?</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> It's damage to the eyes. Why would you not be able to get a child? I know a person that has a blind mother. It's no reason not to have one.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> You totally can! I didn\u2019t know this until recently (in same boat, good a1c no retinopathy yet) but they actually have you come in during your first trimester and maybe more often just to make sure you don\u2019t develop it during pregnancy. You should be fine though to have kids if you do get diagnosed it just could cause it to get worse or pop up.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> I have had retinopathy since birth and have a child.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> I was told at a high risk pregnancy consult that any diabetes complications you have will get worse during pregnancy. If you don't have retinopathy going into it, it won't cause it. But if you do, then it could make it worse. Some people recover after pregnancy is over.\n\nWomen with T1 can totally have babies, it's just a lot of extra planning and work.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> There is a large Type 1 Diabetes and Pregnancy group on Facebook that is a great resource. I don\u2019t have retinopathy, but I\u2019ve seen other women post about it. I know multiple women in the group have had successful pregnancies with retinopathy. You should join. I had a relatively easy, healthy pregnancy with T1- DM me if you have questions.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 6:</b> I have had retinopathy since my early thirties the primary concern is a lot of the treatment is not available or extremely limited if needed. Pregnancy tends to cause added stress on the cardiovascular system that may already be damaged by diabetes. So that is why they are so concerned with t1 pregnancies. The hormone swings make things really hard to control. So complications can result. For someone like myself, that gets eye shots every 6-8 weeks, I wouldn\u2019t be able to receive them during my pregnancy (my ophthalmologist indicated 1 could be done in an emergency). The ANTI VEGF that stops new blood vessels developing in the eye, is also pretty dangerous to fetus development. So, you kind of have to weigh the risks and rewards. I don\u2019t want kinds or am open to adoption if I change my mind, so it wasn\u2019t an issue, but for others it could be a very stressful set of problems to deal with.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 7:</b> Totally possible! I had treatments (both injections and surgeries) for years for fairly severe diabetic retinopathy.  I put off getting pregnant an extra year so I could get vitrectomy surgeries.  Finally I got the \"do it if you have to\" go ahead from my retinopathist. I was so afraid of the stress on my body from the pregnancy making it worse. My a1cs during pregnancy were also in the 5s-mid 6s. I had zero issues with retinopathy or edema during pregnancy.  My baby is 9 months old and doctor says he still wouldn't recommend more treatment right now.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 8:</b> I was diagnosed at 5 with type 1 and had an A1C as high as 10 in my younger years and have two healthy teenagers now. Don\u2019t freak yourself out, diabetes doesn\u2019t mean kids are out of the question!<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 9:</b> I was diagnosed with early signs of retinopathy 13 years ago. Ive had no changes to my vision. Many appointments, including the last one, they saw NO signs of retinopathy. The early signs are just a \"let's watch that when you come in next year\" situation.
