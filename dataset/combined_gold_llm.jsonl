UK resident here and I would like to hopefully get some help from friends on this sub.\n\nRecently I've decided I want to start eating healthy, had a bit of a spell of eating so many bags of crisps and choccy bars lol. I have started replacing carb heavy meals (more than 60g carbs) with low carb alternatives so for example for tea today I ate.\n\n- 80g Brussel sprouts\n- 80g Carrots\n- 80g Broccoli\n- 80g cauliflower\n- 200g chicken\n\nNow the carbohydrates of this meal added up to around 15g carbs. I also add mint sauce and mix it in for flavour so that is like an extra 5-10g carbs.\n\nSo for this meal I take 3 units of Novo-rapid insulin. I have this meal a few times per week however I always notice that my blood sugar levels will rise from around 5.6mmol/L(100.8Mg/dl) to 12(216Mg/dl), about 3 hours later, needing me to take a correction. (Estimation but it always rises a bit)\n\nI've looked at the carb content time and time again and meticiously measured them and they are bang on. I know my insulin sensitivity is ok because when I eat porridge for breakfast my blood sugar goes fine.\n\nSo I guess my question is, is there a way to Protein count in diet? Similar to the way we carb count, as I imagine it's the chickens fault? As well as the veg which I think contain protein too.\n\n\nThanks all.\nDan", "claim": "my Dr (who works alongside Dr Bernstein and is a massive fan of low carb for t1d) put me on a 'slower acting' insulin just to take for high protein, low carb meals."}
