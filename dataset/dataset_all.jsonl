The biggest problem you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll probably have is lows, probably hours after drinking while your liver is still busy metabolizing what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve drank. You can either be really slack about your blousing during the night, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll bolus for any meals I have, but small stuff, candy, mixers, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll usually leave until the end of the night. I usually try to do this by including a mixed drink or cup of punch a for every few beers/shots I have. If this seems too cavalier for you, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had lots of success having 15-25 carbs of a snack before bed. I try to pack it in whatever bag I take with me, usually a ziplock bag of oreos or thin mints. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d also recommend an emergency snack just in case you do dip and have nothing on hand. These strategies are really important because glucagons do not work while your body is processing alcohol. When in doubt, aim high, because this isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the time to pass out because of a hypo. Have somebody that can recongnize your symptoms really well, this is also really tricky because being low looks and sounds and feels a lot like being drunk."]}]}

I\u2019m trying to understand this because from what I read on the internet calculating my insulin in take purely based on the carb amount I take is not correct and there are other things to include.

So I\u2018m now more curious because for example this morning around 10-11 AM my glucose levels were around 120+ and I ate 2 slices of bread which each slice contains 26g carbs, a mix of eggs, tomato, onion and paprika food, some cheese, olive and butter. I took 4 units before and 2 units an hour later. Logically it should have been enough but after 3 hours my glucose levels were around 300 and I took 2 more units and it still going up.\n\nSo in general I am very confused and I want to understand better how should I calculate detailly my insulin need and what to consider or if there are any apps that would help me calculate insulin need better I would like to learn them.

The cabin has facilities & a refrigerator.

Be aware if the outdoor activities are such that they are a \"stress\" you may see blood glucose rise due to epinephrine > hepatic glucagon >>> glucose. Given the lag between sensor interstitial fluid glucose reading and actual blood glucose (up to 25 min.), set the alarm to no less than 80 mg/dL and, more importantly, make decisions based on the trend so you can intercept lows before they occur. Once you have a pump, this will be easier to navigate but still requires mindful choices (not mindless).\n\nMy sensor transmits to iPhone and I can see the reading and trend on Apple Watch.

Ravenous hunger, often times not helped with food.\n\n7. Unexpected weight loss or inability to gain weight\n\nThese will often worsen or become more obvious as sugars move higher. In the most severe cases, diabetes needing immediate medical intervention will present with vomiting, shallow breathing, woozy ness, etc.\n\nIf your child has several of these symptoms regularly, then it would be wise to check with your doctor. It doesn't necessaril mean diabetes, but it could be or any other number of treatable conditions.\n\nFailing that, most drug stores now sell over the counter gluconeters and test strips that are not absurdly expensive and do not require a prescription. You can use one of those to check your kiddo's blood sugar a few times (make sure to read up on proper testing procedure first).\n\nIf their fasting glucose (not having esten for 8 hours) is under 70 or over 120 or if their post meal glucose is over 170-180, then that is awarning sign something is up and it's time to see the doctor immediately.\n\nBut beyond that my advice would be... don't panic, regardless of what you discover via symptoms and/or testing. They may be diabetic. They may very well not. But even if they are, while it isn't fun and presents many challenges, it is treatable and manageable.

If he's waking up low there's a good chance he's using too much basal insulin.  It's hard for me to speculate further without knowing what insulin he's using, when he's injecting it, bodyweight, etc., since there are many factors that affect appropriate dosage between individuals.  The fact that his sugars take forever to come up strongly suggest to me that his basal dose is too high though.  If you have a properly titrated basal dose your sugars would theoretically be stable throughout the day if you ate nothing, and if you dropped low due to over-bolusing, it shouldn't take more than 10-15 minutes max. to come back up.  \n\nLikewise, the fact that it shoots high is likely due to his over-correcting due to the severity of the hypoglycaemia symptoms.  If it's then tanking again without him injecting more insulin, his basal insulin dose is **definitely** too high.  If he's using a CGM, then it makes it easier, but what he might want to do is fast for a day (no food or caloric drinks - best to avoid caffeine too) and see how his blood sugars move throughout the day.  If they're dropping, then he needs to reduce his basal dose.  Sadly, many endocrinologists and GPs don't try and educate patients on how to titrate their own doses and instead use the limited information on their hands to decide a dose for them - this is ineffective at best, and dangerous at worst.\n\nAs for management in general, and how to keep stabler blood sugars, in my opinion there's nothing better than low-carb/ketogenic eating.  I would highly recommend reading information such as Dr. Richard K. Bernstein's \"Dr. Bernstein's Diabetes Solution: The Complete Guide to Achieving Normal Blood Sugars\" as a starting point.  He's been T1D himself for many decades and is well into his 80's.  I use a heavily modified version of his low-carb routine/protocol to manage my own diabetes, and I can honestly say that it has saved my life and health.  I have stable and relatively normal blood sugars (a1c of 5.8 and dropping) and I use very little insulin to manage it, which helps to avoid large errors and swings.  It's hard to get into all the details of how to properly figure everything out, since entire essays (and indeed books) can be written on it, but yeah, that book is well worth the 10-15 bucks it costs on Amazon.

I weigh around 60kg now, but I still eat like I weigh 100. Every time I eat, I take insulin, but every time I take insulin, my hunger increases.\n\nSometimes I just don't feel like dealing with hunger, so I only drink water that day, and that's all I consume. And I'm nowhere near as hungry as I am when I take my insulin like I'm supposed to. I can eat until I'm so full I feel like puking, and yet, as soon as I take insulin I get hungry within 15 minutes.\n\nLong story short, I'm going insane with all this hunger. And I'm so tired of this evil cycle of eating > taking insulin > getting hungry > eating > taking insulin > getting hungry > eating > etc.\n\nI take Novorapid and Tresiba, I don't know how many countries they're available in, but I really need to know if anyone else is dealing with this.\n\nI'm a grown man, and I'm not afraid to admit that I sometimes get so frustrated from the hunger that I start crying.

With that being said, insulin is actually anorexigenic, meaning it makes you feel not hungry. So it's unlikely that insulin is causing what you're experiencing.\n\nHowever there is a possible link between insulin resistance and hunger. When you eat lots of high carb foods you end up craving them. It's like an itch, or an urge to keep eating them, not necessarily hunger. If you're feeling it after eating then it's probably this and not hunger. Insulin resistance in T1 is a dangerous game to play so I would talk to your Endo and see if there's anything going on. You may need to make dietary changes.\n\nThere is another possible explanation however. Our beta cells produce more than just insulin, they also make amylin. Since we're T1 we don't have working beta cells so we don't have amylin either. Amylin plays a role in regulating appetite. It suppresses it when you eat, so you begin to feel full and stop eating. Without amylin it is possible that you would not feel full.\nThe caveat here is that amylin is not the major player in satiety either. So it's unlikely to be having a very profound effect.\n\nSo while there are certainly some complications with appetite that are caused by having T1, they're normally not very extreme and most T1s will never really have any issues.\n\nSource: degree in biochemistry\n\n\nEdit: Hey OP I thought about it some more and wanted to add that based off your description I think what might be happening is postprandial spikes in blood sugar are causing your hunger. You mentioned it not being as bad if you don't eat at all, which made you associate it with the insulin you're taking when you eat. Which makes sense. But what I would wager is happening is you're eating and taking the insulin maybe just a little too late. This is making your blood sugar go way up right after you eat, but then plummeting back down awhile after because of the insulin. The high blood sugar makes you feel hungry and the plummeting afterwards exacerbates it. \n\nWhat kind of bolusing are you doing and when? I would suggest carefully trying to take your insulin sooner, even if that means you take it before eating. Hopefully this will help mellow out the \"rollercoaster\" you're experiencing and I bet it will help with your gnawing hunger pangs too!"}, {"id": 6, "text": "I\u2019ve been a type 1 diabetic since I was 12 and well I gained weight not directly bc of insulin, but bc of the hunger that comes with it so I understand where ur coming from.

I've tried diets and crazy carb counting, but the only way I ever seem to get it close to 100% is by correcting my morning feet-to-floor syndrome and then basically not eating all day because eating will affect my blood sugar.

If you\u2019re on a Dexcom or Libre, I think you can enter your insulin doses or activities in the apps, but consider a separate app like MySugr or SugarMate (those two were my favourites) where you can include additional details like what you ate, illness, or what kind of activity you did. \n- Prebolus! Give that insulin at least 15 minutes before a meal unless you\u2019re about to be physically active, then consider how active you\u2019re going to be and adjust your timing and dose based on that. \n- Know how your body responds to different foods: pizza, fast food, and sushi tend to be difficult to give insulin for because of the delayed time for them to break down, so if you\u2019re eating these, don\u2019t jump in with your insulin too soon, but be prepared to need to give yourself a good dose of insulin to compensate for the tsunami of carbs. \n- If you\u2019re finding a lot of highs/lows around exercise, take some time to research [ExCarbs](https://www.diabetesnet.com/diabetes-control/exercise-and-diabetes/excarbs-exercise/)\u2026 this page is full of crappy ads but the main content is good. The ExCarbs info is to help you figure out what level of exercise you\u2019re doing and how much to either reduce insulin or increase carb intake by before your activity. \n- Try to find balance with your meals: protein, veg, and starch. Fibre. Try to avoid those breakfast options that spike your BG like oatmeal or Mini Wheats as it can set off your whole day.\n- if you have a habit of looking at your phone while eating, make a cheeky little Lock Screen that says something like *\u201cSure you can eat that, but did you take your insulin for it?\u201d*. Before I got on the CGM I had a reminder to get me to test my blood sugar that said \u201cif you can scroll, you can test\u201d and it helped keep me accountable to test 10-12 times a day, which brought my A1c down to about 6%. \n- If you\u2019re interested in reading, try a copy of [The Book of Better](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/0307720683/) or [Bright Spots and Landmines](https://www.amazon.ca/Bright-Spots-Landmines-Diabetes-Someone/dp/0692875174/).. I found these books both to be quite helpful. \n- Celebrate your wins, and don\u2019t beat yourself up for a bad day; they happen to everyone.  \n\n\n**MOHLTC ASSISTIVE DEVICES PROGRAM**\n\nQualifications for insulin pump and pump supply coverage through the Assistive Devices Program is available [here](https://www.ontario.ca/page/get-support-for-diabetes-equipment-and-supplies). They\u2019ll provide you with a pump and $2400 ($600 every 3 months) for pump supplies; anything *exceeding* that amount can be claimed on health insurances or as medical expenses for your taxes (with proof that you\u2019ve exceeded the $2400/yr). \n\nTypically coverage is based on:\n- You are an Ontario resident with an Ontario Health card\n- You monitor your BG level at least 4 times a day (the CGM fulfills this requirement)\n- You attend appointments at the recommended frequency of your endocrinologist (e.g., usually every 4-6 months)\n- You have comprehension of carbohydrate counting, correction dosing, making adjustments if you\u2019re sick, etc. \n- Number of highs/lows requiring third party intervention from family member or emergency services \n- Your HBA1c is 9% or below - note: this might not be a requirement anymore, but it still was when I was last approved \n\nYour clinic will complete the documentation for you; you may need to fill out the first section. You would also need to complete pump training where your diabetes educator and/or a representative from your preferred pump company would review how to use the pump (e.g., selecting an infusion site, inserting the set, filling your cartridge, setting your insulin rates such as basal rates, correction factors, insulin:carb ratio, syncing your CGM if you use one, learning about the \u201cinsulin on board\u201d or active insulin, and reviewing other features like insulin suspension, creating new insulin setting programs, etc.) \n\nIn my experience, an endo wants to see that you\u2019re working toward meeting your goals because a pump isn\u2019t a bandage solution to having good control.

{"id": "ywm7ez", "post": "How am I supposed to get insulin for next year?\nBackstory: I\u2019m 27 and have been on a marketplace insurance plan for a few years now because I make about 34k a year. I\u2019m going to graduate from university and hopefully get an engineering job approximately may or June and average pay for entry level positions here are 75k a year I\u2019ve done some rough math and with my expected income I\u2019ll make too much money and I don\u2019t qualify for any marketplace tax credit and all of the plans that I used to be able to afford are now $600-$700 a month premiums (I pay about $80 now). I can\u2019t afford that on my salary now,, I\u2019m living paycheck to paycheck as is. The cheapest plans dont cover anything and cost 4x as much.\nIn all of the interviews  I\u2019ve had so far I asked how soon I can get coverage after starting,, the average time is 2 months after start date. I suspected this might happen so I have been filing my scripts religiously as soon as I can but here we are in November and I only have enough to last me until April and I likely won\u2019t be able to afford coverage until august! How am I going to get insulin?", "comments": [{"id": 1, "text": "Would you ever consider making a move to a country with free health care like the U.K.?

Basically it\u2019s a card you get from their website. Very quick and easy. It lets you buy your insulin each month for 45 dollars, regardless of how much you use. So tell your doctor you\u2019re using more insulin and bam you can get a ton of insulin for 45 dollars a month. No insurance needed"}, {"id": 3, "text": "Okay so, it\u2019s not the end of the world. That\u2019s not how it works. (Source: had marketplace insurance and switched mid year because I got a good full time job) You\u2019re going to be okay, please don\u2019t panic. \n\nIt\u2019s income adjusted. You get to keep your marketplace plan until your new workplace insurance kicks in. You get to keep your subsidy until your income changes. So here\u2019s how it works!\n\nNow: renew your marketplace plan or pick a new one. You get a subsidy. Keep refilling your stuff like a champ. \n\nMay: congratulations on graduation! \n\nMay/June/whatever: start your new job AND call the marketplace and adjust to your new income. It\u2019s a form, they were super nice to me when I did it. You will probably lose most, if not all of your subsidy. \n\nJuly/August: your new insurance kicks in. Call the marketplace by mid month to cancel your plan. \n\nIf you forget to adjust and it doesn\u2019t start until the next month, that\u2019s fine. You repay it in your taxes. There\u2019s a max for how much they can make you repay. You will have insurance and insulin. You\u2019ll also start a new deductible with your new insurance which sucks."}, {"id": 4, "text": "hopefully you find a job that provides coverage immediately. some places have a waiting period, some don\u2019t. i just started a new job and my\ninsurance was effective my first day."}, {"id": 5, "text": "Start hoarding.
