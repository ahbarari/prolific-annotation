All things considered, we\u2019re lucky we have technology that we do.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> It's a bit of a \"boy who cried wolf\" situation. I've lost track of how many promising studies and new technologies that have been sent to me. Each one more promising than the last. And each one has led to us still using the same mdi/pump system we've had for years. \n\nThe meme of a cure being just 10 years away has been around for decades. And a decade later, I have no doubt that we'll be here reading about the next promising study that definitely will work this time...\n\nIs it fair for me to judge this one based of the failure if others? Probably not... but thats life. Color me unimpressed until they have real products available for me to use and not just read about in an article\n\nIf I had a dollar for every promising study to cure diabetes, I'd finally be able to afford a pump...<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> There was a Viacyte participant on the Juicebox podcast. She couldn\u2019t really talk about outcomes, but she started her experience being a trial participant. Her story inspired me to finish my application for the Radiant trial (which is more about understanding atypical presentations of diabetes, but still a contribution to the future).<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> Encapsulation has huge promise.

We also have A1cs that are lower by a statistically significant margin, reflecting application of knowledge gained through participation and exchange of ideas, which goes hand-in-hand with following research and keeping up to date with the latest news/information/ideas.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 7:</b> I first heard about this years ago (2016) where they were using seaweed to encapsulate the beta cells.  The issue comes down to the same thing, while it works it works well, but you have to be reinjected with new betas cells every 2-3 years, because our bodies destroy the ones we generate.

Soon, we are going on vacation to a very remote area with spotty cell service and will be hiking. I am getting very anxious because we have 2 youngish kids and a dog we are also taking and recently my husband has been experiencing quick drops and his CGM says he is in the 50s and sometimes 40s (his meter usually reads a bit higher). I am getting really anxious that something will happen while we are in the woods and I will not be able to help him (and the kids). I always have a \"crash stash\" and glucose tabs with me but these crashes have been happening so fast I am scared even after he corrects it will take to long to get back in range.\nDoes anyone have any advice or tips for this situation? I think I am especially nervous because early in our marriage we were on a hike and we ran out of the crash stash and he was losing his vision and stumbling and there was no one but me to help. Obviously it worked out fine but the anxiety surrounding this trip is extreme. I think having a solid plan in place will help.

Sorry to ramble on!</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> For me, hiking is a sugar drain and I have to adjust basal and lower my carb to insulin ratio.  If you are going to a higher elevation, that is going to make a difference as well   For emergencies, I recommend that you get a prescription for glucagon or something like it.  You can administer it for emergencies and will take him out of extreme low pretty quick.  Before going on the hike, get to know this stuff and how to administer it so you don't feel panicked and have to try to read the tiny print on how to use it!  I think there is an inhaled one now but I haven't had to use it so I don't know much about it.     \n\nHe will likely be fine but I have used this for a family member who also has T1, it's good to have on hand even when not going out off the grid.  It's literally a life saver!  With this in your pack at all times, you will have less to worry about, so you can enjoy more of the trip!<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> Honey would be a great addition to your supplies. As well as the glucagon.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> In addition to the other tips, maybe for hiking, he could raise his low alert to warn before he\u2019s low. I have mine at 75 during the day, so I can prevent a true low before it happens. For hiking, and quick drops, maybe a little higher than that would help.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> Decrease insulin/basal. Err on the side if high BG; for a few days with limited food I'd rather be 150-180 mg/dL than struggling to keep BG up. As mentioned above raise the \"low\" alarm. Eat food *before* you actually get low. Timing if food intake is just as important to BG management.\n\nVariety of sugars, quick acting stuff (gummies, liquids) and slow absorption whole wheats, protiens, etc. True preparation is at 50 - 100% more than you think you'll need. \n\nGlucogon can be used as a last resort if someone is unconscious, less risky than honey under the tounge or similar.\n\nCurious how this goes. Good on ya'll for getting out there with the family. The extra work of proper T1D managemant totally makes the experience extra rewarding!<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> When I go on bike rides, I lower my basal and don't take bolus for food before the ride. For long rides I always take peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and dates sliced open with embedded walnuts.\n\nYou shouldn't need glucagon as it's intended for someone who is having insulin shock/seizure...\n\nLive Long and Prosper.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 6:</b> Preload with lots of protein and fat.

I swap a lot out with cauliflower;pizza crust, rice, noodles, tator tots, etc. And have learned to love veggies more in general. Takes training and I am NOT a health nut.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> If he's waking up low then he needs to either eat more before bed or he needs to lower his nightly basal. He doesn't need to be on a diet, just eat well balanced meals. Has he gone through a type 1 diabetic class offered by the hospital? Also, if he's going low and then shooting high it means he's over correcting his lows- which is sometimes unavoidable but I'd tell him to get some glucose tabs and figure out what his ratio is to get him to a normal level. Everyone is different - so let's say he's at 64 - one person might need just 1 glucose tab to get them back in range while another person may need 2. After taking the glucose tabs he'll still want to watch himself until he's at a normal level because if he's dropping rapidly he may need more glucose tabs than normal. Also, staying hydrated can help keep sugar levels in range as well.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> Record blood sugars for a week.  Consult with endocrinologist.\n\nCould be as simple as his basal rate being too high.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> This is pretty common. It USUALLY starts when you overcompensate for a low blood sugar. For most Lows you only need 10-20g of carbs however, because your brain is telling you THIS IS AN EMERGENCY YOU ARE STARVING TO DEATH, people go overboard and eat WAY TOO MUCH. Then over a couple hours, blood sugar will rise. Trying to get the high to come down quicker, you'll take too much insulin and crash in a few hours and the cycle starts again. \n\nHe prob needs to lower his morning basel rate, stop that morning low and you'll stop the whole cycle. \n\nExercise and diet do help. But everyone is different so you'll have to see what foods effect his blood sugar. Generally speaking, high protein/fat foods paired with carbs can stabilize blood sugar (eggs and toast/ peanut butter and honey)<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 6:</b> A big problem with T1DM is that the sugar goes high and doesn't come down.\n\nHe needs to eat smaller, more frequent meals.\n\nAnd he needs to balance fat and protein with the carbs - which goes against what we've told everyone else for 50-60 years. Ironically, a croissant coated in fat and oil, with an egg, is better than a lone slice of bread.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 7:</b> T1D here since 2011.    \nThis is a pretty common issue (one that I'd had myself in the past).  If he's waking up low there's a good chance he's using too much basal insulin.  It's hard for me to speculate further without knowing what insulin he's using, when he's injecting it, bodyweight, etc., since there are many factors that affect appropriate dosage between individuals.  The fact that his sugars take forever to come up strongly suggest to me that his basal dose is too high though.  If you have a properly titrated basal dose your sugars would theoretically be stable throughout the day if you ate nothing, and if you dropped low due to over-bolusing, it shouldn't take more than 10-15 minutes max. to come back up.  \n\nLikewise, the fact that it shoots high is likely due to his over-correcting due to the severity of the hypoglycaemia symptoms.  If it's then tanking again without him injecting more insulin, his basal insulin dose is **definitely** too high.  If he's using a CGM, then it makes it easier, but what he might want to do is fast for a day (no food or caloric drinks - best to avoid caffeine too) and see how his blood sugars move throughout the day.  If they're dropping, then he needs to reduce his basal dose.  Sadly, many endocrinologists and GPs don't try and educate patients on how to titrate their own doses and instead use the limited information on their hands to decide a dose for them - this is ineffective at best, and dangerous at worst.\n\nAs for management in general, and how to keep stabler blood sugars, in my opinion there's nothing better than low-carb/ketogenic eating.  I would highly recommend reading information such as Dr. Richard K. Bernstein's \"Dr. Bernstein's Diabetes Solution: The Complete Guide to Achieving Normal Blood Sugars\" as a starting point.  He's been T1D himself for many decades and is well into his 80's.  I use a heavily modified version of his low-carb routine/protocol to manage my own diabetes, and I can honestly say that it has saved my life and health.

Soon, we are going on vacation to a very remote area with spotty cell service and will be hiking. I am getting very anxious because we have 2 youngish kids and a dog we are also taking and recently my husband has been experiencing quick drops and his CGM says he is in the 50s and sometimes 40s (his meter usually reads a bit higher). I am getting really anxious that something will happen while we are in the woods and I will not be able to help him (and the kids). I always have a \"crash stash\" and glucose tabs with me but these crashes have been happening so fast I am scared even after he corrects it will take to long to get back in range.\nDoes anyone have any advice or tips for this situation? I think I am especially nervous because early in our marriage we were on a hike and we ran out of the crash stash and he was losing his vision and stumbling and there was no one but me to help.

If you are going to a higher elevation, that is going to make a difference as well   For emergencies, I recommend that you get a prescription for glucagon or something like it.  You can administer it for emergencies and will take him out of extreme low pretty quick.  Before going on the hike, get to know this stuff and how to administer it so you don't feel panicked and have to try to read the tiny print on how to use it!  I think there is an inhaled one now but I haven't had to use it so I don't know much about it.     \n\nHe will likely be fine but I have used this for a family member who also has T1, it's good to have on hand even when not going out off the grid.  It's literally a life saver!

He doesn't need to be on a diet, just eat well balanced meals. Has he gone through a type 1 diabetic class offered by the hospital? Also, if he's going low and then shooting high it means he's over correcting his lows- which is sometimes unavoidable but I'd tell him to get some glucose tabs and figure out what his ratio is to get him to a normal level. Everyone is different - so let's say he's at 64 - one person might need just 1 glucose tab to get them back in range while another person may need 2. After taking the glucose tabs he'll still want to watch himself until he's at a normal level because if he's dropping rapidly he may need more glucose tabs than normal. Also, staying hydrated can help keep sugar levels in range as well.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> Record blood sugars for a week.  Consult with endocrinologist.\n\nCould be as simple as his basal rate being too high.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> This is pretty common. It USUALLY starts when you overcompensate for a low blood sugar. For most Lows you only need 10-20g of carbs however, because your brain is telling you THIS IS AN EMERGENCY YOU ARE STARVING TO DEATH, people go overboard and eat WAY TOO MUCH. Then over a couple hours, blood sugar will rise. Trying to get the high to come down quicker, you'll take too much insulin and crash in a few hours and the cycle starts again. \n\nHe prob needs to lower his morning basel rate, stop that morning low and you'll stop the whole cycle. \n\nExercise and diet do help. But everyone is different so you'll have to see what foods effect his blood sugar. Generally speaking, high protein/fat foods paired with carbs can stabilize blood sugar (eggs and toast/ peanut butter and honey)<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 6:</b> A big problem with T1DM is that the sugar goes high and doesn't come down.\n\nHe needs to eat smaller, more frequent meals.\n\nAnd he needs to balance fat and protein with the carbs - which goes against what we've told everyone else for 50-60 years. Ironically, a croissant coated in fat and oil, with an egg, is better than a lone slice of bread.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 7:</b> T1D here since 2011.    \nThis is a pretty common issue (one that I'd had myself in the past).  If he's waking up low there's a good chance he's using too much basal insulin.  It's hard for me to speculate further without knowing what insulin he's using, when he's injecting it, bodyweight, etc., since there are many factors that affect appropriate dosage between individuals.  The fact that his sugars take forever to come up strongly suggest to me that his basal dose is too high though.  If you have a properly titrated basal dose your sugars would theoretically be stable throughout the day if you ate nothing, and if you dropped low due to over-bolusing, it shouldn't take more than 10-15 minutes max. to come back up.  \n\nLikewise, the fact that it shoots high is likely due to his over-correcting due to the severity of the hypoglycaemia symptoms.  If it's then tanking again without him injecting more insulin, his basal insulin dose is **definitely** too high.  If he's using a CGM, then it makes it easier, but what he might want to do is fast for a day (no food or caloric drinks - best to avoid caffeine too) and see how his blood sugars move throughout the day.  If they're dropping, then he needs to reduce his basal dose.  Sadly, many endocrinologists and GPs don't try and educate patients on how to titrate their own doses and instead use the limited information on their hands to decide a dose for them - this is ineffective at best, and dangerous at worst.\n\nAs for management in general, and how to keep stabler blood sugars, in my opinion there's nothing better than low-carb/ketogenic eating.  I would highly recommend reading information such as Dr. Richard K. Bernstein's \"Dr. Bernstein's Diabetes Solution: The Complete Guide to Achieving Normal Blood Sugars\" as a starting point.  He's been T1D himself for many decades and is well into his 80's.  I use a heavily modified version of his low-carb routine/protocol to manage my own diabetes, and I can honestly say that it has saved my life and health.  I have stable and relatively normal blood sugars (a1c of 5.8 and dropping) and I use very little insulin to manage it, which helps to avoid large errors and swings.  It's hard to get into all the details of how to properly figure everything out, since entire essays (and indeed books) can be written on it, but yeah, that book is well worth the 10-15 bucks it costs on Amazon.  I've never felt as healthy as I do now with near-normal blood sugars.\n\nApologies for the long reply, but best of luck to you and your brother!

But some oj is no biggie and a small amount won\u2019t spike his bg too much. <br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> What are his bg #s in the morning?  When your sugar gets low, things stop making sense.  Your brain isn\u2019t firing on all cylinders, with low bg, and it  can become difficult communicating & understanding what someone is trying to do to help you.  I have \u201cfought\u201d a roommate who was trying to give me juice.  I keep the applesauce packs in a drawer by the bed, the ones that come with a lid and you suck them out of the packet like they make for kids, that helps me get 15g of carbs real quick & that allows me to at least be a active about it and not try to argue and fight over the juice.  Have you explained his behavior to him?  It is frustrating & baffling to us as well.  <br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> When i was around 60-70 in the mornings, i took 27 units of basal. I lowered it to 25 and it went up to around 80-90. So lower it but be careful. Drinking soda or juice as soon as possible is very helpful, you don't want to go too low for too long.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> T1 here and I can confirm that being low or really high can and does cause sometimes drastic mood shifts, they are terrible. However, with tighter BG control they can be much more easily managed. Talk to him about this in a constructive manner at some point in the day where you are both open to a difficult conversation. \n\nUltimately, it is his responsibility to manage this disease to the best of his abilities and there are hosts of resources available to assist him in doing so. Like I said, this happens to me as well, so my advice is coming from a place of sympathy. I\u2019ve read lots of books on managing T1D and can recommend some of them to you if you like, but he needs to be ready to take on the responsibility of his diabetes which will, in the short and long term, dramatically enhance the quality of his life. <br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> I agree that he shouldn\u2019t be waking up low, but yeah, the moods are reeeeeal. <br><br>\n  <b>Comment 6:</b> It may not be low blood sugar. It may just me hangry. I will get that way when I have not eaten for extended periods of time. Get him to snack on something when he gets up. It's like those snicker commercials. It's an actual thing! <br><br>\n  <b>Comment 7:</b> Moods are real. I\u2019m a T1. It sucks. My SO deals with it amazingly by not shaming me. I have had the \u201cdiabetic talk\u201d explaining how sugars affect me.  And he just knows when and knows there is nothing he can do to change things. I am also the kind where when it happens, I need to deal, let me rant and eat what I don\u2019t want to. It fuckin sucks having your body control you in this way and having to take care of it or you die. That\u2019s the basic underline of the shitty attitude. \n\n\nIf you can deal and let him rant. Deal and that\u2019s great, but it\u2019s gonna be life long and if you can\u2019t, leave. Also, have a convo when things are normal in case he does realize what\u2019s happening, it\u2019s a relational disease, as sucky as that sounds. A lot of T1s (me included) hate acknowledging this bc it\u2019s such a personal and lonely disease. <br><br>\n  <b>Comment 8:</b> Honestly that sounds exactly like how I act when my sugar gets low. Just the other night my sugar was low and I was trying to fix a drawer. My wife came to help and I instantly just got upset with her and flustered with the drawer I wasn't having any luck fixing. Doesn't help that my brain doesn't seem to process anything correctly when I am low either.\n\nIf that is a constant trend he should be able to talk to his doctor and they should be able to help him fix his morning sugar so he isn't always running low.<br><br>\n", "label_annotations": {"no_claim": {"No claim detected.": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 9s "}}

He is type one and having issues with keeping his sugars stable. Wakes up low, takes forever to come up then shoots high, tanks, shoots high. What can he do to keep his levels better sustained throughout the day? Diet plans? Exercise routine thats good? Anyone have anything theyve done that improved the struggle any?</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> New to this, sorry if this is such an obvious answer question!<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> Is he manually chwcking or does he have a cgm? I struggled checking manually, having the cgm leaves no room for guessing and has helped me take ownership of my levels in real time, rather than catching up, reacting late.\nAlso, I have realy started to focus on keto, as much as possible. I swap a lot out with cauliflower;pizza crust, rice, noodles, tator tots, etc. And have learned to love veggies more in general. Takes training and I am NOT a health nut.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> If he's waking up low then he needs to either eat more before bed or he needs to lower his nightly basal. He doesn't need to be on a diet, just eat well balanced meals. Has he gone through a type 1 diabetic class offered by the hospital? Also, if he's going low and then shooting high it means he's over correcting his lows- which is sometimes unavoidable but I'd tell him to get some glucose tabs and figure out what his ratio is to get him to a normal level. Everyone is different - so let's say he's at 64 - one person might need just 1 glucose tab to get them back in range while another person may need 2. After taking the glucose tabs he'll still want to watch himself until he's at a normal level because if he's dropping rapidly he may need more glucose tabs than normal. Also, staying hydrated can help keep sugar levels in range as well.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> Record blood sugars for a week.  Consult with endocrinologist.\n\nCould be as simple as his basal rate being too high.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> This is pretty common. It USUALLY starts when you overcompensate for a low blood sugar. For most Lows you only need 10-20g of carbs however, because your brain is telling you THIS IS AN EMERGENCY YOU ARE STARVING TO DEATH, people go overboard and eat WAY TOO MUCH. Then over a couple hours, blood sugar will rise. Trying to get the high to come down quicker, you'll take too much insulin and crash in a few hours and the cycle starts again. \n\nHe prob needs to lower his morning basel rate, stop that morning low and you'll stop the whole cycle. \n\nExercise and diet do help. But everyone is different so you'll have to see what foods effect his blood sugar. Generally speaking, high protein/fat foods paired with carbs can stabilize blood sugar (eggs and toast/ peanut butter and honey)<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 6:</b> A big problem with T1DM is that the sugar goes high and doesn't come down.\n\nHe needs to eat smaller, more frequent meals.\n\nAnd he needs to balance fat and protein with the carbs - which goes against what we've told everyone else for 50-60 years. Ironically, a croissant coated in fat and oil, with an egg, is better than a lone slice of bread.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 7:</b> T1D here since 2011.    \nThis is a pretty common issue (one that I'd had myself in the past).  If he's waking up low there's a good chance he's using too much basal insulin.  It's hard for me to speculate further without knowing what insulin he's using, when he's injecting it, bodyweight, etc., since there are many factors that affect appropriate dosage between individuals.  The fact that his sugars take forever to come up strongly suggest to me that his basal dose is too high though.  If you have a properly titrated basal dose your sugars would theoretically be stable throughout the day if you ate nothing, and if you dropped low due to over-bolusing, it shouldn't take more than 10-15 minutes max. to come back up.  \n\nLikewise, the fact that it shoots high is likely due to his over-correcting due to the severity of the hypoglycaemia symptoms.  If it's then tanking again without him injecting more insulin, his basal insulin dose is **definitely** too high.  If he's using a CGM, then it makes it easier, but what he might want to do is fast for a day (no food or caloric drinks - best to avoid caffeine too) and see how his blood sugars move throughout the day.  If they're dropping, then he needs to reduce his basal dose.  Sadly, many endocrinologists and GPs don't try and educate patients on how to titrate their own doses and instead use the limited information on their hands to decide a dose for them - this is ineffective at best, and dangerous at worst.\n\nAs for management in general, and how to keep stabler blood sugars, in my opinion there's nothing better than low-carb/ketogenic eating.  I would highly recommend reading information such as Dr. Richard K. Bernstein's \"Dr. Bernstein's Diabetes Solution: The Complete Guide to Achieving Normal Blood Sugars\" as a starting point.  He's been T1D himself for many decades and is well into his 80's.  I use a heavily modified version of his low-carb routine/protocol to manage my own diabetes, and I can honestly say that it has saved my life and health.  I have stable and relatively normal blood sugars (a1c of 5.8 and dropping) and I use very little insulin to manage it, which helps to avoid large errors and swings.  It's hard to get into all the details of how to properly figure everything out, since entire essays (and indeed books) can be written on it, but yeah, that book is well worth the 10-15 bucks it costs on Amazon.  I've never felt as healthy as I do now with near-normal blood sugars.\n\nApologies for the long reply, but best of luck to you and your brother!

Soon, we are going on vacation to a very remote area with spotty cell service and will be hiking. I am getting very anxious because we have 2 youngish kids and a dog we are also taking and recently my husband has been experiencing quick drops and his CGM says he is in the 50s and sometimes 40s (his meter usually reads a bit higher). I am getting really anxious that something will happen while we are in the woods and I will not be able to help him (and the kids). I always have a \"crash stash\" and glucose tabs with me but these crashes have been happening so fast I am scared even after he corrects it will take to long to get back in range.\nDoes anyone have any advice or tips for this situation? I think I am especially nervous because early in our marriage we were on a hike and we ran out of the crash stash and he was losing his vision and stumbling and there was no one but me to help. Obviously it worked out fine but the anxiety surrounding this trip is extreme. I think having a solid plan in place will help. My husband keeps saying he will be fine and that he will tell me if he is dropping but I need a more concrete plan. Sorry to ramble on!</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> For me, hiking is a sugar drain and I have to adjust basal and lower my carb to insulin ratio.  If you are going to a higher elevation, that is going to make a difference as well   For emergencies, I recommend that you get a prescription for glucagon or something like it.  You can administer it for emergencies and will take him out of extreme low pretty quick.  Before going on the hike, get to know this stuff and how to administer it so you don't feel panicked and have to try to read the tiny print on how to use it!  I think there is an inhaled one now but I haven't had to use it so I don't know much about it.     \n\nHe will likely be fine but I have used this for a family member who also has T1, it's good to have on hand even when not going out off the grid.  It's literally a life saver!  With this in your pack at all times, you will have less to worry about, so you can enjoy more of the trip!<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> Honey would be a great addition to your supplies. As well as the glucagon.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> In addition to the other tips, maybe for hiking, he could raise his low alert to warn before he\u2019s low. I have mine at 75 during the day, so I can prevent a true low before it happens. For hiking, and quick drops, maybe a little higher than that would help.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> Decrease insulin/basal. Err on the side if high BG; for a few days with limited food I'd rather be 150-180 mg/dL than struggling to keep BG up. As mentioned above raise the \"low\" alarm. Eat food *before* you actually get low. Timing if food intake is just as important to BG management.\n\nVariety of sugars, quick acting stuff (gummies, liquids) and slow absorption whole wheats, protiens, etc. True preparation is at 50 - 100% more than you think you'll need. \n\nGlucogon can be used as a last resort if someone is unconscious, less risky than honey under the tounge or similar.\n\nCurious how this goes. Good on ya'll for getting out there with the family. The extra work of proper T1D managemant totally makes the experience extra rewarding!<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> When I go on bike rides, I lower my basal and don't take bolus for food before the ride. For long rides I always take peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and dates sliced open with embedded walnuts.\n\nYou shouldn't need glucagon as it's intended for someone who is having insulin shock/seizure...\n\nLive Long and Prosper.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 6:</b> Preload with lots of protein and fat.
