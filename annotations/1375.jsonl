I have been trying to do a lot of research over the past few days because I suspect I have type 1 diabetes. However, one of my main issues I believe is hypoglycemia (chills in morning, heart racing when i wake up) and it seems though people are saying that too much insulin is usually the cause for it. As someone that has never used insulin once before, can this be possible? Or can I rule out type 1 diabetes as a possible condition.</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> If you are undiagnosed diabetic, it is very unlikely you would experience hypoglycemia.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> If you don\u2019t mind me asking, how old are you? If you are a child/young adult with undiagnosed type 1 diabetes you would be in a permanent state of hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar) rather than hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). \n\nSome non-diabetics are susceptible to low blood sugars but this is usually following intense exercise, not as a matter of routine such as waking up<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> There can be other reasons for experiencing hypoglycemia. Typically undiagnosed diabetics experience high blood sugars as the pancreas produces less insulin. \n\nThat being said, when I was in middle school (before diagnosis) I often experienced passing out and low blood sugars after extended periods of exercise. Doctors said this was unrelated to my diagnosis, but I suspect that it could have been a precursor to the disease. That was 4+ years before I was diagnosed with diabetes. \n\nA diabetes diagnosis will usually occur after high blood sugars. You would experience intense thirst, peeing a lot, sometimes nausea, extreme weight loss, and fatigue.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> Doubt it. The main issue an undiagnosed type 1 diabetic has is usually high blood sugar/ hyperglycaemia.\n\nEdit I have done some googling. It seems that hypos are (to an extent) normal after intense exercise even for non-diabetics. \n\nBut if its at other times when you haven't been exercising it seems strange<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> Have you checked your thyroid recently? I'm type 1 so not the best example for you but I experienced heart racing + chills when I started getting thyroid issues.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 6:</b> For a year or so before one of my kids was diagnosed type 1, they had hypos every morning when they woke up. (Didn't know that's what it was at the time.) Shaking was the #1 thing we noticed. It is actually very common for people with Type 1 to experience hypos prior to diagnosis. In fact, the morning of the day she was diagnosed (with a BG of 450), her fasting BG was 39.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 7:</b> Definitely consult your health care provider, if you do not have a specialist like an endocrinologist look into getting one. Sounds like you need lab work done. Your thyroid and adrenal glands can create adverse physical symptoms as well so it\u2019s best to be sure. Good luck!<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 8:</b> You can have low blood sugar prior to being dx with Type 1 diabetes.

Then, I\u2019d inject long acting insulin. This way, during summers where I was really active and swimming and sweating and in the sand, I could be detached from my pump, but not have to inject every time I wanted a snack / meal because I could just reconnect my pump to bolus quickly. The long acting insulin took the place of my basal rate on my pump and I was free to only have to wear my pump when is needed to bolus.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> I don\u2019t see why not, I know people that use inhaled insulin for blousing because it acts quicker, but I\u2019m curious why you\u2019d want to do this? \n\nFor me, the convenience of pumping and not having to bring pens/vials with me everywhere is one of the huge pros<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> I like to take shots for some meals. It works faster/better. I need more insulin on the pump for meals than I do with shots and I spike higher on the pump than I do with shots. So some meals I def use an injection!<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> Yes, definitely can!\n\nMark Andrews (the NFL tight end) actual does sort of backwards, does half his basal via injection then half via the pump, so he can take it off during practice.\n\nP.S. I've heard of some omnipod users inject large boluses via pen, and then small corrections and basal via pump.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> Yes, I did this while pregnant so I didn\u2019t have to change my pod every day! I was taking ginormous amounts of insulin. Other people do an injection of long-acting and use the pump for meal boluses. I bet if you google \u201cuntethered\u201d insulin pump things would come up.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 6:</b> Yes. Actually,  it's something alot of pregnant diabetics will do because once insulin resistant hits, pumps hardly last the 3 days they're supposed to with the crazy amount of insulin needed.  So,  the pump will take care of basal needs and the injections are for bolusing.<br><br>\n", "label_annotations": {"no_claim": {"No claim detected.": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 53s "}}

It\u2019ll be impossible to gain weight if you\u2019re high all the time. \n\nApart from that it\u2019s really just high fat and high carb foods. Not necessarily bad fats. Plain Greek yogurt/low fat milk/dark chocolate are all a part of my diet and help me keep good weight. Avocados, bananas, pasta, potatoes come to mind as well.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> Never thought I'd see a question like this! I am really having trouble losing weight, I don't have to do anything to gain weight.. (insulin promotes fat creation)<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> I used to eat a cup of shelled sunflower seeds a day when I was bodybuilding.  It\u2019s relatively low carb if I remember correctly and 1 cup of shelled seeds provides around 700 calories.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> Carbs, mostly, over high fats. But again with the first reply you can't gain weight with high blood sugars, the body cells starve and start eating themselves.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> I'm an old school T1D.  Been T1D for over 50 years.  I'm still using Novolin N and R twice a day.  When I want to lose weight, I cut back on my Novolin R before dinner and do a postprandial walk of 3-5 miles to burn off the calories.  To gain weight I increase the Novolin R to be able to consume more calories.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 6:</b> I've found it's easier to gain muscle over fat with type 1, but to just look healthier and a bit more \"filled out,\" just work hard to keep your numbers in check, eat reasonable carbs that are easy to process/calculate how much insulin to dose, and eat a ton of protein and fat. Keeping your numbers lower is the most important part about keeping weight on though.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 7:</b> High fat, high carb diet. Basically lots of insulin will fatten you up, be careful of your sugar levels though.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 8:</b> How old is he?  I graduated high school at 6'3\" and 168 pounds.  Grew another inch and grew shoulders in college and graduated college at 6'4\" and 185.  Around 27 y.o. my metabolism finally started to slow down and finally cracked 200.  At 40 I actually had to start watching what I ate as I was up to 220 and with 4 kids, no time to exercise and cleaning up what they didnt eat.  I played sports in college and they had me on 6000 calorie diets to gain weight for over a year.  Might just be metabolism.  Have him track calories and then bring that in to his next appointment with his endocrinologist to discuss.  I really would not mess with insulin to gain weight, unless Dr. Is ok with that.  Skinny sucks, overweight sucks, but doing irreversible damage because of playing games with insulin, not my recommendation.

I accepted a long time ago that it would be expensive and stressful to eat the carbs required to gain weight, like I was able to in the army, without being very dangerous to myself. Some body types, like mine, just don't gain weight as easily.\n\nWeight lifting can make a large impact in increasing your mass and weight, but will still require carbs.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 11:</b> How\u2019s his control?

Have at least one friend around who knows how to recognize and treat a low or severe high.\n\nBe willing to run a little high if necessary. A drunk night at 180-200 is better than risking a devastating low.\n\nBut really staying aware of your readings is most important. Even if you barely remember the next day, a low or high reading is probably going to trigger your drunk mind to either eat or bolus/inject as necessary.\n\nETA: Also consider what you\u2019re drinking. Alcohol is different for everyone. For me beer raises my blood sugar, hard liquor has no impact (unless mixed with a sugary drink), and wine seems to lower my blood sugar.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> i personally avoid carby alcohol like beer and wine. if i go for cocktails, i dont give any insulin as the alcohol content will lower me while the sugar in the mixers will keep me higher.\nif mixing a spirit and diet mixer i make sure to keep snacking through the night (like small crisps or something)\n\nmake sure there's someone with you who knows how to look out for a hypo in you and keep checking sugars often.\n \ni went out the other day for cocktails but still had to suspend my basal a few hours later as the alcohol made me drop quite quick so watch out for that as well<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> My nurse told me that after a night out, I should eat junk food and not shoot insulin for it.

And it's too busy with the alcohol to release sugar to compensate for a low.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> I know this will get downvoted because it\u2019s not what you want to hear, but you could try moderation. Just one or two drinks. \n\nYou could offer to be the designated driver! \n\nThat is the only sure way to drink safely as a person living with t1d.

Gotta stay in control, you know? \n\nBe safe!<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 6:</b> Eat before. Test lots. Make sure you have a snack before bed (this one is the most important). From my own experience, I bolus for the first two beers max, but then don\u2019t for any more. I usually stick with Gin and Soda as that keeps me stable, but after 5 I will start to trend down. Even if my sugars are on the higher side (8-9), I would have a peanut butter sandwich with no bolus before sleeping so that I don\u2019t go low. \n\nWatch out for lows the next day! I usually only need minimal basal if any. Which is nice, especially if you want hungover chinese food.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 7:</b> Eat<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 8:</b> Eat a solid meal beforehand. For me protien helps keep sugars up but not super high. 6 hours later is kind of a gamble.\n\nCheck your sugar as often as you can; the more you know the better. But in the end it's better to be high than low.\n\nHaving someone around who knows your T1D in case things go really wrong can be a good buffer.

As a cell keeps breaking off phosphate groups from ATP for energy, ATP turns into ADP and then AMP (tri-phosphate -> di-phosphate -> mono-phosphate), and when AMP levels rise it sends a \u201clow energy\u201d signal, which among other things triggers AMPK to allow glucose into the cell without needing insulin. People with type 1 who do tons of sub-zone 2 exercise can get down to frankly ridiculous insulin requirements (like 10-12u TDD), because they\u2019re shuttling so much glucose into cells via this mechanism.\n\nAs to why, insulin resistance can have a variety of causes, and sometimes it\u2019s a transient thing (cortisol, high levels of fatty acids in the bloodstream after a meal, etc). If you\u2019ve already checked the main ones (weight, sleep, exercise, diet), the next step is mentioning it to your endo.\n\nUnder the \u201cno risk\u201d bucket of things to try, there\u2019s lots of anecdotal (and some clinical) evidence pointing to copper, selenium, and magnesium supplements improving insulin sensitivity.<br><br>\n", "label_annotations": {"no_claim": {"No claim detected.": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 7s "}}

However, this last week has been a struggle for some reason. It seems like not matter what I do I can't get it to stay below 200. I exercise, eat pretty well(no fast food and watch the carbs), don't really drink, and don't smoke but having a hard time getting it down. \n\nExample: Sugar is 138 about to eat so I take Humalog. Made a sandwich, portioned out some chips, and had unsweet tea. 3 hours later my sugar is 240 and my CGM says it's trending upwards. Take 10units only to find it does nothing.  Dinner time comes and I'm still around 230. I take my normal 20units but don't eat and watch my monitor. 2 hrs later sugar is only 220. Go to bed after taking my Lantus, wake up and my sugar is 240. Ugggggghhhh. Take 20 units and 2 hrs later it's still 220. Take 10 more units and 2 hrs later it's up 240 and I haven't eaten and just had water to drink.\n\nBeen like this all week.

Also I hope to calm some of your nerves.\n\nI went through a bad period of bad life circumstances, bad access to insulin, and depression. My bg was NOT good. \n\nRecently, I noticed periods of blurred vision and I developed spots in my vision. I had the same retinopathy fears. It was shocking because at every yearly exam I had healthy eyes. (Still do, yay!)\n\nI went to the doc and found out I have vitreous floaters. My doc said there is no prevention or treatment. She told me it can just happen with age (I'm in my mid 30s; only had type 1 since 2013), but to look out for other issues with my eyes. \n\nI don't want to say you don't have retinopathy.... I don't know your eyes. But I just want to calm fears that this might have some other explanation. Like you said, it might just be a change in your vision.\n\nWith your insurance, if they quoted 5-6 wks. I would call the day after 5 wks and keep calling. There might be nothing they can do, but there might be something they can do. Or at least give you some timeline or information.\n\nAs far as scheduling, I've had people on reddit say I should schedule an urgent appointment. When I scheduled and told them about my issue, they were kinda nonchalant, \"oh ok\" about it lol. Depending on your insurance, call more then one doc and find an appointment as soon as possible.

But you need to be hella careful because diabetes is a real bitch. It can be nothing, could just be floaters. But please get in touch with the new insurance like right after the five week mark. Your eyes are not something to play around with.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 7:</b> They may just be floaters. General rule is if they move around they are harmless.  You don't necessarily have to have crazy high blood sugar levels to develop retinopathy.  It increases the likelihood but is not the only cause.  Definitely take your progress to lower blood sugars slowly. If you develop a solid unmoving shape or notice  dimming or foggy vision please treat it as an emergency.  I am not a doctor and I am not trying to diagnose you.  I have had retinopathy so I understand your fears. I hope you get the insurance sorted soon and chase them up if there are delays.

I have been trying to do a lot of research over the past few days because I suspect I have type 1 diabetes. However, one of my main issues I believe is hypoglycemia (chills in morning, heart racing when i wake up) and it seems though people are saying that too much insulin is usually the cause for it. As someone that has never used insulin once before, can this be possible? Or can I rule out type 1 diabetes as a possible condition.</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> If you are undiagnosed diabetic, it is very unlikely you would experience hypoglycemia.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> If you don\u2019t mind me asking, how old are you? If you are a child/young adult with undiagnosed type 1 diabetes you would be in a permanent state of hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar) rather than hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). \n\nSome non-diabetics are susceptible to low blood sugars but this is usually following intense exercise, not as a matter of routine such as waking up<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> There can be other reasons for experiencing hypoglycemia. Typically undiagnosed diabetics experience high blood sugars as the pancreas produces less insulin. \n\nThat being said, when I was in middle school (before diagnosis) I often experienced passing out and low blood sugars after extended periods of exercise. Doctors said this was unrelated to my diagnosis, but I suspect that it could have been a precursor to the disease. That was 4+ years before I was diagnosed with diabetes. \n\nA diabetes diagnosis will usually occur after high blood sugars. You would experience intense thirst, peeing a lot, sometimes nausea, extreme weight loss, and fatigue.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> Doubt it. The main issue an undiagnosed type 1 diabetic has is usually high blood sugar/ hyperglycaemia.\n\nEdit I have done some googling. It seems that hypos are (to an extent) normal after intense exercise even for non-diabetics. \n\nBut if its at other times when you haven't been exercising it seems strange<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> Have you checked your thyroid recently? I'm type 1 so not the best example for you but I experienced heart racing + chills when I started getting thyroid issues.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 6:</b> For a year or so before one of my kids was diagnosed type 1, they had hypos every morning when they woke up. (Didn't know that's what it was at the time.) Shaking was the #1 thing we noticed. It is actually very common for people with Type 1 to experience hypos prior to diagnosis. In fact, the morning of the day she was diagnosed (with a BG of 450), her fasting BG was 39.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 7:</b> Definitely consult your health care provider, if you do not have a specialist like an endocrinologist look into getting one.

I played sports in college and they had me on 6000 calorie diets to gain weight for over a year.  Might just be metabolism.  Have him track calories and then bring that in to his next appointment with his endocrinologist to discuss.  I really would not mess with insulin to gain weight, unless Dr. Is ok with that.

For me beer raises my blood sugar, hard liquor has no impact (unless mixed with a sugary drink), and wine seems to lower my blood sugar.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> i personally avoid carby alcohol like beer and wine. if i go for cocktails, i dont give any insulin as the alcohol content will lower me while the sugar in the mixers will keep me higher.\nif mixing a spirit and diet mixer i make sure to keep snacking through the night (like small crisps or something)\n\nmake sure there's someone with you who knows how to look out for a hypo in you and keep checking sugars often.\n \ni went out the other day for cocktails but still had to suspend my basal a few hours later as the alcohol made me drop quite quick so watch out for that as well<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> My nurse told me that after a night out, I should eat junk food and not shoot insulin for it. Works for me, but I only got really drunk a few times after diagnosis. Covid etc.\n\nLiver burns sugar when getting rid of alcohol.

Just one or two drinks. \n\nYou could offer to be the designated driver! \n\nThat is the only sure way to drink safely as a person living with t1d. I learned that the hard way when I was in my 20\u2019s. It\u2019s been 20 years since I was drunk or high. I don\u2019t miss it. At all. \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I still enjoy beer, wine, and the occasional high ball, but inebriation is just not an option. Gotta stay in control, you know? \n\nBe safe!<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 6:</b> Eat before. Test lots. Make sure you have a snack before bed (this one is the most important). From my own experience, I bolus for the first two beers max, but then don\u2019t for any more. I usually stick with Gin and Soda as that keeps me stable, but after 5 I will start to trend down. Even if my sugars are on the higher side (8-9), I would have a peanut butter sandwich with no bolus before sleeping so that I don\u2019t go low. \n\nWatch out for lows the next day! I usually only need minimal basal if any. Which is nice, especially if you want hungover chinese food.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 7:</b> Eat<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 8:</b> Eat a solid meal beforehand.

But in the end it's better to be high than low.\n\nHaving someone around who knows your T1D in case things go really wrong can be a good buffer.

After going into DKA (Diabetic ketoacidosis) and many doctor visits we discovered what we thought was type 2 is type 1 but he also suffers from RLS. He had RLS problems prior to the hospital trip but seems like now we have his sugar in a manageable range his RLS is a thousand times worse.  Like he doesn't sleep,  he can't.  Fights his legs all night long.  Numerous medications thrown at him with no relief,  we have resorted to compression,  tens, and massage all for him to just suffer through it.  He gets maybe 1 night good rest a week.  He no longer takes any oral meds after deciding none of them help,  they make it worse.  I'm in desperate search of something to get him relief.  I have read that iron is a good start,  anyone have success rather quickly with this? Any other remedies you'd suggest? Is there a link in RLS and diabetes?

During my first pregnancy I lowered my A1C from 8.7 to 5.9 in a matter of a month or two and ended up with some hemorrhaging in my left eye. Thankfully it healed up and I\u2019m fine, but for sure other\u2019s it has caused more permanent problems. I\u2019d check with your doctors to be safe.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> To preface this: this might not be the best advice, but this is experiences I have had, and what I would do if I were you. Also I hope to calm some of your nerves.\n\nI went through a bad period of bad life circumstances, bad access to insulin, and depression. My bg was NOT good. \n\nRecently, I noticed periods of blurred vision and I developed spots in my vision. I had the same retinopathy fears. It was shocking because at every yearly exam I had healthy eyes. (Still do, yay!)\n\nI went to the doc and found out I have vitreous floaters. My doc said there is no prevention or treatment. She told me it can just happen with age (I'm in my mid 30s; only had type 1 since 2013), but to look out for other issues with my eyes. \n\nI don't want to say you don't have retinopathy.... I don't know your eyes. But I just want to calm fears that this might have some other explanation. Like you said, it might just be a change in your vision.\n\nWith your insurance, if they quoted 5-6 wks. I would call the day after 5 wks and keep calling. There might be nothing they can do, but there might be something they can do. Or at least give you some timeline or information.\n\nAs far as scheduling, I've had people on reddit say I should schedule an urgent appointment. When I scheduled and told them about my issue, they were kinda nonchalant, \"oh ok\" about it lol. Depending on your insurance, call more then one doc and find an appointment as soon as possible. If you feel like you need to. Obviously your choice.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> I\u2019m 18 diagnosed at the age of 4, the whole eye stuff definitely scares me. I hope everything works out for you<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> The potential increase in eye issues when lowering a1c is temporary- and keeping the a1c steady and low (close to normal) will keep them healthy. Follow up with your eye doc when you can! (If you\u2019re nervous you could try a slower descent to normal instead of so abrupt?)<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 6:</b> I have retinopathy and it sucks. I\u2019m a fragile/brittle diabetic. Was diagnosed at age 7, and I\u2019m 36 now. I had a1c\u2019s that went up and down my sugars vary between 100-300 real quick. But you need to be hella careful because diabetes is a real bitch. It can be nothing, could just be floaters. But please get in touch with the new insurance like right after the five week mark. Your eyes are not something to play around with.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 7:</b> They may just be floaters. General rule is if they move around they are harmless.  You don't necessarily have to have crazy high blood sugar levels to develop retinopathy.  It increases the likelihood but is not the only cause.  Definitely take your progress to lower blood sugars slowly. If you develop a solid unmoving shape or notice  dimming or foggy vision please treat it as an emergency.  I am not a doctor and I am not trying to diagnose you.  I have had retinopathy so I understand your fears. I hope you get the insurance sorted soon and chase them up if there are delays.  Wishing you the very best.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 8:</b> Yes, I was blind for months after I got home from initial diagnosis, guess it dropped to fast and \u201cflooded\u201d my lenses. Everything looked like I was under water. Finally reading glasses helped and it eventually went nearly back to normal. At least til the astigmatism kicked in, oh the migraines! Anyway, it\u2019ll be worth getting an eye check when you can. <3<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 9:</b> Get them checked ASAP.

People with type 1 who do tons of sub-zone 2 exercise can get down to frankly ridiculous insulin requirements (like 10-12u TDD), because they\u2019re shuttling so much glucose into cells via this mechanism.\n\nAs to why, insulin resistance can have a variety of causes, and sometimes it\u2019s a transient thing (cortisol, high levels of fatty acids in the bloodstream after a meal, etc).

Or can I rule out type 1 diabetes as a possible condition.</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> If you are undiagnosed diabetic, it is very unlikely you would experience hypoglycemia.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> If you don\u2019t mind me asking, how old are you? If you are a child/young adult with undiagnosed type 1 diabetes you would be in a permanent state of hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar) rather than hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). \n\nSome non-diabetics are susceptible to low blood sugars but this is usually following intense exercise, not as a matter of routine such as waking up<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> There can be other reasons for experiencing hypoglycemia. Typically undiagnosed diabetics experience high blood sugars as the pancreas produces less insulin. \n\nThat being said, when I was in middle school (before diagnosis) I often experienced passing out and low blood sugars after extended periods of exercise. Doctors said this was unrelated to my diagnosis, but I suspect that it could have been a precursor to the disease. That was 4+ years before I was diagnosed with diabetes. \n\nA diabetes diagnosis will usually occur after high blood sugars. You would experience intense thirst, peeing a lot, sometimes nausea, extreme weight loss, and fatigue.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> Doubt it. The main issue an undiagnosed type 1 diabetic has is usually high blood sugar/ hyperglycaemia.\n\nEdit I have done some googling. It seems that hypos are (to an extent) normal after intense exercise even for non-diabetics. \n\nBut if its at other times when you haven't been exercising it seems strange<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> Have you checked your thyroid recently? I'm type 1 so not the best example for you but I experienced heart racing + chills when I started getting thyroid issues.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 6:</b> For a year or so before one of my kids was diagnosed type 1, they had hypos every morning when they woke up. (Didn't know that's what it was at the time.) Shaking was the #1 thing we noticed. It is actually very common for people with Type 1 to experience hypos prior to diagnosis. In fact, the morning of the day she was diagnosed (with a BG of 450), her fasting BG was 39.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 7:</b> Definitely consult your health care provider, if you do not have a specialist like an endocrinologist look into getting one. Sounds like you need lab work done. Your thyroid and adrenal glands can create adverse physical symptoms as well so it\u2019s best to be sure. Good luck!<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 8:</b> You can have low blood sugar prior to being dx with Type 1 diabetes. But more concerning than random lows would be signs of diabetes like extreme thirst, frequent urination, exhaustion, etc.<br><br>\n", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 639, "end": 726, "span": "If you are undiagnosed diabetic, it is very unlikely you would experience hypoglycemia.", "annotation": "verifiable claim"}, {"start": 800, "end": 916, "span": "If you are a child/young adult with undiagnosed type 1 diabetes you would be in a permanent state of hyperglycaemia ", "annotation": "verifiable claim"}, {"start": 1983, "end": 2075, "span": " It seems that hypos are (to an extent) normal after intense exercise even for non-diabetics", "annotation": "verifiable claim"}], "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 3s "}}

After going into DKA (Diabetic ketoacidosis) and many doctor visits we discovered what we thought was type 2 is type 1 but he also suffers from RLS. He had RLS problems prior to the hospital trip but seems like now we have his sugar in a manageable range his RLS is a thousand times worse.  Like he doesn't sleep,  he can't.  Fights his legs all night long.  Numerous medications thrown at him with no relief,  we have resorted to compression,  tens, and massage all for him to just suffer through it.  He gets maybe 1 night good rest a week.  He no longer takes any oral meds after deciding none of them help,  they make it worse.  I'm in desperate search of something to get him relief.  I have read that iron is a good start,  anyone have success rather quickly with this? Any other remedies you'd suggest? Is there a link in RLS and diabetes? Any suggestions or insight appreciated.</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> I don't know if there is a link, but I have the exact same problems. Now I just try to walk a couple miles each night before bed...seems if I tire them out enough, they calm down. If I don't, they jump and thrash all night. Seems to work better when I wear heels, I think it causes more pull on the muscle, which makes them tire even more. \n\nBest of luck to you both, I know it's a pain in the ass!<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> According to Wikipedia here: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restless_legs_syndrome it says that diabetes is a risk factor. But it also says that it\u2019s linked to lots of other stuff. Maybe other options are worth exploring as well.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> Thank you,  walking is definitely something we have looked at although it is entirely too hot outside to do so right now lol south Louisiana heat definitely causes a rise in his numbers. He does a ton of walking while at work, which we find makes them worse. Probably doesn't help he is in steel toe boots all day long.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> I'll start by saying I don't have anything that I've found useful. I was diagnosed with t1d and rls in the same year, and my rls is horrendous. the sleep specialist I saw for a second opinion had me get iron infusions, and after that didn't work, he came to the same conclusion as the first, that I had tried everything else and my only option left was methadone, and my answer to that was absolutely not. \n\nbeing more active, but nothing too strenuous, during the day helps me fall asleep easier, but I still have to have my own bed because of how much I kick and thrash in my sleep. I don't ever remember waking up, but sleep studies have confirmed that I do. extremely frequently. but the pharmaceutical options currently available don't work and I'm tired of trying after over a decade so I guess I'm just sorta forcing my way thru it. \n\nget in to see a sleep specialist or neurologist if you can!!<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> has he tried vitamin supplements with calcium and magnesium?<br><br>\n", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 1497, "end": 1620, "span": "According to Wikipedia here: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restless_legs_syndrome it says that diabetes is a risk factor.", "annotation": "verifiable claim"}, {"start": 3036, "end": 3095, "span": "has he tried vitamin supplements with calcium and magnesium", "annotation": "verifiable claim"}], "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 8m 12s "}}

Any tips to avoid?</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> If you guys have a designated person usually they love doing all this medical stuff atleast my friends do hahaha. I usually tell them to give me 2 shots if my sugar is over 12 cause trying to stay tight never works.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> Check your blood sugar as often as possible. \n\nHave something to correct a low. Have at least one friend around who knows how to recognize and treat a low or severe high.\n\nBe willing to run a little high if necessary. A drunk night at 180-200 is better than risking a devastating low.\n\nBut really staying aware of your readings is most important. Even if you barely remember the next day, a low or high reading is probably going to trigger your drunk mind to either eat or bolus/inject as necessary.\n\nETA: Also consider what you\u2019re drinking. Alcohol is different for everyone. For me beer raises my blood sugar, hard liquor has no impact (unless mixed with a sugary drink), and wine seems to lower my blood sugar.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> i personally avoid carby alcohol like beer and wine. if i go for cocktails, i dont give any insulin as the alcohol content will lower me while the sugar in the mixers will keep me higher.\nif mixing a spirit and diet mixer i make sure to keep snacking through the night (like small crisps or something)\n\nmake sure there's someone with you who knows how to look out for a hypo in you and keep checking sugars often.\n \ni went out the other day for cocktails but still had to suspend my basal a few hours later as the alcohol made me drop quite quick so watch out for that as well<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> My nurse told me that after a night out, I should eat junk food and not shoot insulin for it. Works for me, but I only got really drunk a few times after diagnosis. Covid etc.\n\nLiver burns sugar when getting rid of alcohol. And it's too busy with the alcohol to release sugar to compensate for a low.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> I know this will get downvoted because it\u2019s not what you want to hear, but you could try moderation. Just one or two drinks. \n\nYou could offer to be the designated driver! \n\nThat is the only sure way to drink safely as a person living with t1d. I learned that the hard way when I was in my 20\u2019s. It\u2019s been 20 years since I was drunk or high. I don\u2019t miss it. At all. \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I still enjoy beer, wine, and the occasional high ball, but inebriation is just not an option. Gotta stay in control, you know? \n\nBe safe!<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 6:</b> Eat before. Test lots. Make sure you have a snack before bed (this one is the most important). From my own experience, I bolus for the first two beers max, but then don\u2019t for any more. I usually stick with Gin and Soda as that keeps me stable, but after 5 I will start to trend down. Even if my sugars are on the higher side (8-9), I would have a peanut butter sandwich with no bolus before sleeping so that I don\u2019t go low. \n\nWatch out for lows the next day! I usually only need minimal basal if any. Which is nice, especially if you want hungover chinese food.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 7:</b> Eat<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 8:</b> Eat a solid meal beforehand. For me protien helps keep sugars up but not super high. 6 hours later is kind of a gamble.\n\nCheck your sugar as often as you can; the more you know the better. But in the end it's better to be high than low.\n\nHaving someone around who knows your T1D in case things go really wrong can be a good buffer. Like if you're getting really sloppy, they can check your BG and at least know you're drunk and not super low.\n\nParty On!<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 9:</b> Never drink on an empty stomach<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 10:</b> 1. Eat before (something substantial)\n\n2. Check sugars every 45-60mins if you remember. Don\u2019t be to far away from quick acting carbs\n\n3. Have someone in the group know you have diabetes \n\n4. Have something to eat when you get home (best to make it before you go)\n\n5.
