As a cell keeps breaking off phosphate groups from ATP for energy, ATP turns into ADP and then AMP (tri-phosphate -> di-phosphate -> mono-phosphate), and when AMP levels rise it sends a \u201clow energy\u201d signal, which among other things triggers AMPK to allow glucose into the cell without needing insulin. People with type 1 who do tons of sub-zone 2 exercise can get down to frankly ridiculous insulin requirements (like 10-12u TDD), because they\u2019re shuttling so much glucose into cells via this mechanism.\n\nAs to why, insulin resistance can have a variety of causes, and sometimes it\u2019s a transient thing (cortisol, high levels of fatty acids in the bloodstream after a meal, etc). If you\u2019ve already checked the main ones (weight, sleep, exercise, diet), the next step is mentioning it to your endo.\n\nUnder the \u201cno risk\u201d bucket of things to try, there\u2019s lots of anecdotal (and some clinical) evidence pointing to copper, selenium, and magnesium supplements improving insulin sensitivity."}], "claims": [{"comment_id": 1, "claims": []}, {"comment_id": 2, "claims": [" I recommend a faster working insulin like Fiasp, and pre-bolusing about thirty minutes before your meal.", "I recommend a faster working insulin like Fiasp, and pre-bolusing about thirty minutes before your meal."]}, {"comment_id": 3, "claims": []}, {"comment_id": 4, "claims": ["sometimes it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a transient thing (cortisol, high levels of fatty acids in the bloodstream after a meal, etc).", "Under the \u00e2\u0080\u009cno risk\u00e2\u0080\u009d bucket of things to try, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lots of anecdotal (and some clinical) evidence pointing to copper, selenium, and magnesium supplements improving insulin sensitivity."]}]}
