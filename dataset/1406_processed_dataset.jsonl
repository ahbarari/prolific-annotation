I can eat until I'm so full I feel like puking, and yet, as soon as I take insulin I get hungry within 15 minutes.\n\nLong story short, I'm going insane with all this hunger.

With that being said, insulin is actually anorexigenic, meaning it makes you feel not hungry. So it's unlikely that insulin is causing what you're experiencing.\n\nHowever there is a possible link between insulin resistance and hunger. When you eat lots of high carb foods you end up craving them. It's like an itch, or an urge to keep eating them, not necessarily hunger. If you're feeling it after eating then it's probably this and not hunger. Insulin resistance in T1 is a dangerous game to play so I would talk to your Endo and see if there's anything going on. You may need to make dietary changes.\n\nThere is another possible explanation however. Our beta cells produce more than just insulin, they also make amylin. Since we're T1 we don't have working beta cells so we don't have amylin either. Amylin plays a role in regulating appetite. It suppresses it when you eat, so you begin to feel full and stop eating. Without amylin it is possible that you would not feel full.\nThe caveat here is that amylin is not the major player in satiety either. So it's unlikely to be having a very profound effect.\n\nSo while there are certainly some complications with appetite that are caused by having T1, they're normally not very extreme and most T1s will never really have any issues.\n\nSource: degree in biochemistry\n\n\nEdit: Hey OP I thought about it some more and wanted to add that based off your description I think what might be happening is postprandial spikes in blood sugar are causing your hunger. You mentioned it not being as bad if you don't eat at all, which made you associate it with the insulin you're taking when you eat. Which makes sense. But what I would wager is happening is you're eating and taking the insulin maybe just a little too late. This is making your blood sugar go way up right after you eat, but then plummeting back down awhile after because of the insulin. The high blood sugar makes you feel hungry and the plummeting afterwards exacerbates it. \n\nWhat kind of bolusing are you doing and when? I would suggest carefully trying to take your insulin sooner, even if that means you take it before eating. Hopefully this will help mellow out the \"rollercoaster\" you're experiencing and I bet it will help with your gnawing hunger pangs too!"}, {"id": 6, "text": "I\u2019ve been a type 1 diabetic since I was 12 and well I gained weight not directly bc of insulin, but bc of the hunger that comes with it so I understand where ur coming from.

ABSOLUTELY find a new doctor."}, {"id": 27, "text": "Hi fellow Ontarian! \ud83d\udc4b Sharing a bunch of info below. \n\n**TIPS FOR BG CONTROL**\n\nAlright so I\u2019m going to come from the angle of getting my A1c down to 4.9% during a recent pregnancy: \n\n- Document the shit out of everything while you\u2019re waiting for your endo\u2019s approval. If you\u2019re on a Dexcom or Libre, I think you can enter your insulin doses or activities in the apps, but consider a separate app like MySugr or SugarMate (those two were my favourites) where you can include additional details like what you ate, illness, or what kind of activity you did. \n- Prebolus! Give that insulin at least 15 minutes before a meal unless you\u2019re about to be physically active, then consider how active you\u2019re going to be and adjust your timing and dose based on that. \n- Know how your body responds to different foods: pizza, fast food, and sushi tend to be difficult to give insulin for because of the delayed time for them to break down, so if you\u2019re eating these, don\u2019t jump in with your insulin too soon, but be prepared to need to give yourself a good dose of insulin to compensate for the tsunami of carbs. \n- If you\u2019re finding a lot of highs/lows around exercise, take some time to research [ExCarbs](https://www.diabetesnet.com/diabetes-control/exercise-and-diabetes/excarbs-exercise/)\u2026 this page is full of crappy ads but the main content is good. The ExCarbs info is to help you figure out what level of exercise you\u2019re doing and how much to either reduce insulin or increase carb intake by before your activity. \n- Try to find balance with your meals: protein, veg, and starch. Fibre. Try to avoid those breakfast options that spike your BG like oatmeal or Mini Wheats as it can set off your whole day.\n- if you have a habit of looking at your phone while eating, make a cheeky little Lock Screen that says something like *\u201cSure you can eat that, but did you take your insulin for it?\u201d*. Before I got on the CGM I had a reminder to get me to test my blood sugar that said \u201cif you can scroll, you can test\u201d and it helped keep me accountable to test 10-12 times a day, which brought my A1c down to about 6%. \n- If you\u2019re interested in reading, try a copy of [The Book of Better](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/0307720683/) or [Bright Spots and Landmines](https://www.amazon.ca/Bright-Spots-Landmines-Diabetes-Someone/dp/0692875174/).. I found these books both to be quite helpful. \n- Celebrate your wins, and don\u2019t beat yourself up for a bad day; they happen to everyone.  \n\n\n**MOHLTC ASSISTIVE DEVICES PROGRAM**\n\nQualifications for insulin pump and pump supply coverage through the Assistive Devices Program is available [here](https://www.ontario.ca/page/get-support-for-diabetes-equipment-and-supplies). They\u2019ll provide you with a pump and $2400 ($600 every 3 months) for pump supplies; anything *exceeding* that amount can be claimed on health insurances or as medical expenses for your taxes (with proof that you\u2019ve exceeded the $2400/yr). \n\nTypically coverage is based on:\n- You are an Ontario resident with an Ontario Health card\n- You monitor your BG level at least 4 times a day (the CGM fulfills this requirement)\n- You attend appointments at the recommended frequency of your endocrinologist (e.g., usually every 4-6 months)\n- You have comprehension of carbohydrate counting, correction dosing, making adjustments if you\u2019re sick, etc. \n- Number of highs/lows requiring third party intervention from family member or emergency services \n- Your HBA1c is 9% or below - note: this might not be a requirement anymore, but it still was when I was last approved \n\nYour clinic will complete the documentation for you; you may need to fill out the first section. You would also need to complete pump training where your diabetes educator and/or a representative from your preferred pump company would review how to use the pump (e.g., selecting an infusion site, inserting the set, filling your cartridge, setting your insulin rates such as basal rates, correction factors, insulin:carb ratio, syncing your CGM if you use one, learning about the \u201cinsulin on board\u201d or active insulin, and reviewing other features like insulin suspension, creating new insulin setting programs, etc.) \n\nIn my experience, an endo wants to see that you\u2019re working toward meeting your goals because a pump isn\u2019t a bandage solution to having good control. With that said, I\u2019ve never heard of needing your time in range between 85-100%. \n\nFeel free to reach out if you have other questions; I\u2019ve been on a pump (and covered by ADP) since 2002."}, {"id": 28, "text": "Doctors like this piss me the hell off.
