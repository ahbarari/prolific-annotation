I\u2019ve had it for 2 weeks and have already had 2 get ripped off from either a corner of a wall or the dining room table. Is there a product that hold it on better? Is something to put under a patch to make it more rigid and durable. I will start using a patch more but it don\u2019t seem secure enough.\n\nAlso how do you guys sleep with it on your stomach? It\u2019s so annoying. Is that something I will eventually get use to?</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> It\u2019s part of why I quit the omnipod. It\u2019s just SO massive.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> I keep it on my lower back actually so sleeping on my stomach is no problem at all. Maybe try some other places you can put the pod to see what works better for you?<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> Sleeping you\u2019ll get used to! It takes time but eventually you\u2019ll be able to ignore that part.\n\nAs for hitting it on stuff, try angling your pod differently. If mines on my stomach, I like to have it horizontal or sometimes I\u2019ll go diagonal up or down but far away from my love handles. Arm is tricky sometimes (I accidentally pulled mine off when taking my bra off once \ud83d\ude02) and thigh I just don\u2019t like. Back I\u2019ve never had an issue. You\u2019ll get the hang of it and eventually you won\u2019t hit it all the time!<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> There\u2019s not much you can do to keep it on if you catch it and rip it off. But it does happen less eventually. When I started (12ish years ago) I would hit it all the time. On my arm, it was doorframes, and on my leg, it was\u2026 everything. The worst was ripping it clean off on a school bus seat. Over time I got used to it and now I hardly ever hit it, and when I do it\u2019s just slightly.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> I bought bands that I use while sleeping for my arms because I'm a restless sleepers that covers that pod( almost similar to stretchy under armor but slightly tighter) or I'll use Vet wrap if desperate. I have actually had luck with using my chest  as a site lol apparently boobage absorbs insulin well for me.  As always SkinTac and Simpatch never seem to let me down and I usually have trouble pulling pod off after using SkinTac. Amazon sells different \"belts, arms bands etc for runners that I've used in past that have been helpful.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 6:</b> We use [Pod Pals](https://sugarmedical.com/products/pod-pals-omnipod-adhesive-overlays) to help keep them on. They were recommended by Insulet.<br><br>\n", "label_annotations": {"no_claim": {"No claim detected.": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 2s "}}
{"id": "193by6y", "displayed_text": "<div class='post' style='user-select:none;'>\n  <h2>Post</h2>\n  <p>How do you cope with hyperglycemias?\nHello, I'm 21M I currently live in Czech republic where I attend an university. Just half a year ago I moved away from my family and I live on my own in a rented apartment. I have diabetes for almost 11 years now but I find it increasingly difficult to manage it. Despite the fact that I'm doing literally everything I've been told by my doctor I cannot seem to cope with hyperglycemias. It's more frustrating now since I have important exams that will determine if I'll pass or not. I cannot concentrate, I'm restless even if I sleep longer than I should and learning anything is nearly impossible. I cannot even do the simplest tasks and it's also taking a great toll on my job. Is there anything I can possibly do to somehow supress hyperglycemias effectively in a short period of time? How do you deal with them? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> brisk walk does magic \ud83c\udfa9<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> Is there a pattern? Does the hyperglycemia occur at consistent times, for example after meals or overnight? If it is a regular, recurring thing, it might just mean that you need more insulin at those times. Do you adjust your doses on your own or wait for your doctor to do it? Does it happen when you are stressed at school, such as before an exam? That can be a little harder to control but if it's very consistent (happening every time you have an exam or presentation or whatever) then taking a bit of extra insulin then might also help until you get more used to the new activities and are less stressed by them. As someone else mentioned, a quick walk can also get the insulin working better.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> Either exercise, get insulin, or drink water. I also eat snow sometimes.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> Might seem totally unrelated but the \u201cfight/flight\u201d response kicks in automatically. Over the years it\u2019s easily increased stress levels and subsequent cortisol levels that also affect BG. Breathing and grounding helps me. Doesn\u2019t necessarily have a direct impact and I know only a bit of the physiology, however has helped with the balance a whole lot.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> Highs are usually caused by too low basal dose, too low bolus dose, illness, stress and many other unknown factors. Fix one or more for better control.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 6:</b> Eating less/lower carbohydrates has done wonders for me<br><br>\n", "label_annotations": {"no_claim": {"No claim detected.": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 17s "}}
{"id": "1al4h5c", "displayed_text": "<div class='post' style='user-select:none;'>\n  <h2>Post</h2>\n  <p>How's the iLet?\nMy endocrinologist is recommending that I switch from my Tandem T-Slim to an iLet. If you're using the iLet, how do you like it, and what kind of results are you getting?  Thanks!</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> I'd never heard of it so I googled it. What struck me the most was \"no carb counting\". According to the website: \n\n\"No carb counting  \nInstead of carb counting everything on your plate, the iLet just needs an estimate of the carbs in your meal \u2013 Usual for me, More or Less.\" [https://www.betabionics.com/ilet-bionic-pancreas/ilet-adults/](https://www.betabionics.com/ilet-bionic-pancreas/ilet-adults/) \n\nhmmm I dubious.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> From what I read, the iLet will target a 7.0 a1c. If you are already under that the iLet would be worst<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> The iLet is really designed for people who don't want to think about their diabetes or don't/can't manage it well and just want something to work for them \n\nIt's a good pump, but will cause havoc for the more advanced and well managed users.\n\nIf you go low you have to be super careful how much you treat, and if you're running high you're SOL and have to wait till the pump gives you enough insulin to get you back to target<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> Your Endo is correct in that it's GREAT for people who are at an A1C of 14 (fully unwilling to manage their diabetes) and can help bring them down to around a 7. For those who have tight control it would be a nightmare. I listened to an interview with the founder on The Juice box and he stated that \"post meal of up to 270 was acceptable to their algorithm\". I'm sorry, but if I'm at 205 I'm already range bolusing. If I'm over 220 or so I feel like death. I can't imagine being stuck at 250+ without the ability to bolus down.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> The ilet is an amazing option for people who are burnt out and have dangerously high a1cs, children and teens who have very little parental support, people in a clinical setting (like a nursing home) who have subpar support from staff, people who have disordered eating whose issues are exacerbated by carb counting, and people with cognitive disabilities.\n\nHere is an interview with the creater\nhttps://www.juiceboxpodcast.com/episodes/jbp934\n\nI think it will save countless lives for people who can no longer care for themselves (due to burnout or disability or lack of education on how to manage diabetes)\n\nIt's not a great fit for someone who needs tight control (a pregnant T1D, someone who has late stage kidney failure), someone on a very low carb diet, or someone who prefers very tight control.\n\nMy son has multiple disabilities (he's autistic with an intellectual disability) and we plan on switching to the ilet as he grows older, but for now he's pretty young and living at home so we have very good control on the OP5, and are happy with our current routine. We are not looking to switch anytime soon.\n\nI'm really excited about the research that iLet is doing with a dual pump (that has both insulin and glucagon) but that's several years away from commercial use.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 6:</b> Everyone else's comment is completely on point, I just wanted to add another one that I think the ILet for you would be a big NO. Don't be afraid to assert yourself with your endo!<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 7:</b> NO!!!!! Control IQ is a far superior algorithm to the iLet. The iLet has no way to adjust basal rates or give correction boluses. You just have to wait for the algorithm to figure it out. \n\nIt averages maintaining an A1c of around 7, but many, many people hit 5s on the Tandem, which is basically a non-diabetic A1c.<br><br>\n", "label_annotations": {"no_claim": {"No claim detected.": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 2s "}}
